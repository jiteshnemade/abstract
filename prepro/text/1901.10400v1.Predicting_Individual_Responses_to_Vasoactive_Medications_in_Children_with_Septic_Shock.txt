ABSTRACT
Objective: Predict individual septic children’s personalized physiologic responses to vasoactive titrations by training
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using EMR data.
Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed EMR of patients admitted to a pediatric ICU from 2009
to 2017. Data included charted time series vitals, labs, drugs, and interventions of children with septic shock treated
with dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. A RNN was trained to predict responses in heart rate (HR), systolic
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 8,640 titrations during 652
septic episodes and evaluated on a holdout set of 3,883 titrations during 254 episodes. A linear regression model using
titration data as its sole input was also developed and compared to the RNN model. Evaluation methods included the
correlation coefficient between actual physiologic responses and RNN predictions, mean absolute error (MAE), and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The actual physiologic responses displayed significant variability and were more accurately predicted by
the RNN model than by titration alone (r = 0.20 vs r = 0.05, p < 0.01). The RNN showed MAE and AUC
improvements over the linear model. The RNN’s MAEs associated with dopamine and epinephrine were 1-3% lower
than the linear regression model MAE for HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP. Across all vitals vasoactives, the RNN achieved
1-19% AUC improvement over the linear model.
Discussion: The wide variability of observed responses indicates that many factors other than dose change affect the
response. Not surprisingly, a linear model whose sole input is dose change does not adequately capture the physiologic
changes associated with vasoactive titrations, and is no better than chance in predicting individual patient responses.
The RNN model showed improvement over the linear model in predicting titration response.
Conclusion: This initial attempt in pediatric critical care to predict individual physiologic responses to vasoactive dose
changes in children with septic shock demonstrated an RNN model showed some improvement over a linear model.
While not yet clinically applicable, further development may assist clinical administration of vasoactive medications
in children with septic shock.

INTRODUCTION
Septic shock in children is a deadly disease with an estimated mortality rate of 5-10% with aggressive resuscitation1 .
Prior to institution of guidelines for aggressive resuscitation in septic shock, mortality was as high as 50%2 . Current
recommendations include the early administration of volume, antibiotics, and vasoactive medications to support and
improve end organ perfusion3 . Early reversal of septic shock through early resuscitation has been shown to reduce
mortality by 9-fold compared to patients who did not receive early resuscitation4 .
Early reversal of septic shock using fluid and vasoactive therapies are recommended by the American College of
Critical Care Medicine1 . Literature supports the idea of treating children with cold shock with an epinephrine infusion,
and children with warm shock on an infusion of norepinephrine3 . Dopamine can also be considered as a first line agent
for hemodynamic stabilization in septic shock. In patients with meningococcal sepsis, lack of vasopressor therapy
administration showed increased odds of death (23.7) compared to patients who received vasopressor therapy5 . The
importance of early initiation of vasopressor therapy in patients with fluid-refractory shock cannot be understated.
Despite these recommendations, there is a paucity of literature concerning the hemodynamic response to vasoactives in
children with septic shock. Specifically, the effects of these medications on Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure
(SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) can be difficult to predict in individual
patients, making drug dose titration necessary in a clinical setting. Vasoactives such as dopamine, epinephrine, and
norepinephrine can have strong and adverse effects, and anticipating a child’s response to them is critical.
Early, small-scale studies of the cardiovascular effects of vasoactive medications involved healthy adult males who had
infusions of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Significant findings included increased cardiac output and systolic blood
pressure and decreased peripheral vascular resistance as responses to epinephrine infusion6 . Patients given an infusion
of norepinephrine had uniform increases in systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure6 . These studies paved
the way for modern pharmacokinetic studies, which have further elucidated the mechanism of action and function of
these endogenous vasopressors. Increasing doses of epinephrine during CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests resulted
in an overall linear dose response curve in which higher doses of epinephrine resulted in higher systolic and diastolic
aortic blood pressures7 . A study of adult patients with septic shock reported linear increases in heart rate, mean arterial
blood pressure, and cardiac index (CI) after infusion of epinephrine as a single agent8 . Norepinephrine was found to
have minimal effects on CI or stroke volume index (SVI) in adult patients with septic shock; although in combination
with dobutamine, it was found to increase mean arterial pressure, CI, and SVI9 . Martin et. al. compared dopamine
and norepinephrine for treating hyperdynamic septic shock in adults and found that patients who received epinephrine
had significant increases in MAP and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI); and in patients who did not respond
to high doses of dopamine, addition of norepinephrine produced the previously described changes10 .
Ceneviva et. al. studied septic children with fluid refractory shock and their response to inotropic/vasoactive therapy1 .
These patients were divided into three groups: those with low cardiac index (CI), those with low systemic vascular
resistance index, and those with combined cardiac and vascular dysfunction. They were treated with infusions of
inotropes, vasopressors, or vasodilators depending on their physiology. In 44 of 50 patients studied, vasopressor or
inotrope therapy was altered as a result of hemodynamic variables found by pulmonary artery catheter measurements.
Four of the study patients had a complete change in hemodynamic profile which necessitated a change in vasopressor/inotrope support based on CI and SVRI. This study showed significant heterogeneity in pediatric septic shock
throughout the illness course and need for constant re-evaluation of the patients hemodynamic state.
The significant heterogeneity of septic children’s responses to vasoactive medications suggests that an individual
child’s response depends on many variables other than dose titration alone. Age, number of fluid boluses, concurrent
medications, steroid use, previous medical history, and underlying illness may all affect the response of a septic patient
to vasoactive therapy11 . No studies, of which the authors are aware, have attempted to account for these variables on
an individual level, and this is likely due to the complexity of the problem and limited data.
The ever increasing availability of electronic medical records (EMR) combined with recent advances in machine
learning may enable a more comprehensive analysis of patient data and vasoactive response than previously possible.
This motivated us to hypothesize that a Recurrent neural network (RNN) could extract the relationships between
an individual child’s EMR and that child’s response to vasoactive titration. RNNs are a family of neural network

architectures that were designed to process sequential data and incorporate information from previous inputs when
calculating predictions12, 13 . Successful applications of RNNs include language modeling14 , speech recognition15 and
machine translation16, 17 . More recently, RNNs have been applied to problems in the healthcare domain because of
their suitability for streaming medical data. These include early detection of critical decompensation in children18 ,
onset of heart failure19 , dynamic prediction of mortality risk20, 21 , de-identification of patient notes22 , and prediction
of individual children’s physiologic state associated with successful discharge from a pediatric intensive care unit
(PICU)23 .
OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this study was to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on EMR data to predict individual septic
children’s physiologic response (HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP) to vasoactive titration. A secondary goal was to train a
linear regression model whos sole input is dose change to provide a baseline against which the RNN model can be
compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
This was a retrospective study of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) patients at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles
(CHLA), a tertiary care academic center, between 2009 and 2017. The CHLA Institutional Review Board (IRB)
reviewed the study protocol and waived the need for IRB approval. The data were extracted from de-identified observational clinical data collected in Electronic Medical Records (EMR, Cerner, Kansas City, Mo.) and included time
series of vital signs, labs, drugs, and interventions, as well as demographic information such as gender, race, and ethnicity. Only patients meeting septic shock criteria – an elevated or depressed white blood cell count for the patient’s
age24 , hyperthermia (> 38.5o C) or hypothermia (< 36o C), and antibiotic administration during their hospitalization
– were included. 1,142 episodes (655 children) meeting septic criteria and were treated with dopamine, epinephrine,
or norepinephrine infusions comprised the study cohort.
Response Variables
HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP were examined prior to and following each dose titration, i.e. change in the level of administered dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Changes in these four vital signs defined the response we sought
to model. These changes were calculated at each titration using the mean measurement one hour after titration (postobservation window) minus the mean measurement two hours before titration (pre-observation window), as shown in
Figure 1A. A two minute exclusion window at the time of administration was used to account for perturbations in
actual administration time.
Linear Regression Model
Motivated by previous studies6–8 that modeled physiologic responses to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine
dose changes as linear, we developed linear regression (LR) models of the form y = mx + b as a baseline, where x is
the change in vasoactive dose, and y is the change in a vital sign (HR, SBP, DBP, MAP). The training set was used to
optimize the model parameters m (slope) and b (intercept).
RNN Model
For each vital sign-vasoactive combination, a RNN model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)25 architecture
was developed to predict an individual child’s vital sign response to titrations of that vasoactive. At each time point
where measurements were recorded, a vector containing patient data at that time point was input to the RNN model.
Elements of this vector included vitals, laboratory results, drugs and interventions at that time, as well as demographic
information such as gender and race. Preprocessing steps described in previous work20, 21 converted the EMR into a
temporal sequence of vectors amenable to machine learning. Figure 1B illustrates the flow of input and output through
the RNN. The model makes a prediction at each time point where an input vector exists. The Appendix provides

Figure 1: (A) Visualization of how physiologic responses were calculated. In this example, a vasoactive was titrated
at times tj and tk . The average HR in the 2-hour window prior to the 2-minute exclusion window for ti was 110 bpm.
The average HR in the 1-hour window following the 2-minute exclusion window for ti was 125 bpm. Therefore, the
computed true response for the titration at ti was +15 bpm (125-110). Similarly, the true response for the titration
at tk was -10 bpm (110-120). (B) High level illustration of a RNN for predicting physiologic response to vasoactive

details of the RNN model parameters and training hyperparameters (Table 6) and a list of input variables (Table 7).
Model Training
The error metric used to optimize both LR and RNN model parameters during training was the average of mean
absolute error (MAE) of each vital sign aggregated over the training set. Training hyperparameters for the RNN
model, including the number of hidden units, optimization algorithm, activation function, and learning rate, were
optimized via minimizing MAE on the validation set. Since true responses existed only at times corresponding to
points of titration, the errors were aggregated only from the predictions made at these titration points. For example, in
Figure 1, tj and tk are the only titration time points. Therefore, only the predictions at these two time points would be
included in the error calculation.

Performance Evaluation
Three metrics computed on the test set assessed model performance. The correlation between the true physiologic
response (the measured change in vital sign) and the RNN’s predicted change was calculated. This correlation was
compared to the correlation between titration dose change and the true physiologic response. The MAEs for each vital
sign in each RNN and linear model were also computed. Lastly, the true physiologic responses and predictions were
categorized as either increasing or not increasing. The accuracy of these dichotomous predictions was evaluated using
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Identifying Application and Window Types
Children may receive various interventions and medications simultaneously during their ICU stay. Consequently, it
is difficult to anticipate how an individual child’s physiologic state may or may not respond to a certain sequence or
combination of treatments, let alone one specific treatment. For each vasoactive of interest, we characterized each
titration to aid evaluation of different scenarios in which a child may receive these treatments. This was done by
labeling each titration point and each post-observation window as either independent or correlated.
An Independent Application (IA) occurs when exactly one vasoactive of interest – dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine – is titrated. A Correlated Application (CA) occurs when at least one of these three drugs is titrated at the
same time as another vasoactive that may or may not be one of these three. An Independent Observation (IO) occurs
when the vasoactive of interest is present and no other vasoactives are titrated within the post-observation window. A
Correlated Observation (CO) occurs when the vasoactive of interest is present and another vasoactive titration occurs
within the post-observation window. Figure 2 illustrates the different scenarios for application and observation.
Characterizing the application and observation type of each titration allows for clearer analysis of model performance.
Titrations characterized as an independent application with an independent observation window are the cleanest data
for observing the effect of vasoactives. Nevertheless, all application-observation permutations are important to provide
a more comprehensive representation of vasoactive use in an ICU setting. Table 1 provides the counts of applicationobservation types in the training, validation and test sets for each vasoactive.

RESULTS
Response Range
A wide range of responses to vasoactive titrations was observed (Figure 3, left plots). The interquartile range of
responses (25% / 50% / 75%) of patients given dopamine was -6/1/4 bpm for HR, -11/2/11 mmHg for SBP, -4/6/8
mmHg for DBP, and -7/2/8 mmHg for MAP per 1 mcg/kg/min increase of dopamine. For 0.1 mcg/kg/min increase of
epinephrine, responses were -6/4/9 bpm for HR, -1/12/19 mmHg for SBP, 0/6/13 mmHg for DBP, and 2/8/16 mmHg
for MAP. For 0.01 mcg/kg/min increase of norepinephrine, responses were -4/0/4 bpm for HR, -3/3/12 mmHg for
SBP, -4/2/7 mmHg for DBP, and -2/2/6 mmHg for MAP.
Correlation of Response to Dose Change and RNN Prediction
The correlation coefficient (r) between the true responses and dose changes ranged from -0.02 to 0.06, while r between the true responses and the RNN’s predicted responses ranged from 0.13 to 0.26 (see Figure 3). The difference
between these two correlation coefficients was found to be significant (p < 0.01). The correlation coefficients between
true responses and the titrations characterized as an independent application with independent observation were not
significantly different from other titrations (Table 2).

Evaluation of LR and RNN Predictions Using MAE and AUC
Parameters of the LR models are in the Appendix (Table 5). Table 3 shows the MAEs of the RNN and LR predictions of
HR, SBP, DBP and MAP responses to dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine titrations in the test set. The RNN’s

Figure 3: The left plots (yellow) are the vasoactive dose changes in mcg/kg/min (x-axis) and the measured physiologic
responses (y-axis). The right plots (blue) are the RNN-predicted responses (x-axis) and the measured responses (yaxis). These plots are shown for each drug (top-bottom: Dopamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine). The correlation
coefficient (r) is included for each subplot.

MAEs associated with dopamine and epinephrine were lower by 1-3% than those of LR across all four vitals. The
RNN model had higher MAEs in SBP, DBP and MAP responses to norepinephrine than LR. MAEs aggregated over
the subset of titrations characterized as independent application with independent observations were lower than errors
aggregated over the whole set. This was true for both RNN and LR models across all vasoactive-vital combinations.
Table 4 displays test set AUCs when the models were evaluated on the binary task of predicting whether or not
vitals increased in response to vasoactive titrations. Across all vitals and vasoactives, the RNN achieved 1-19% AUC
improvement over LR, with the largest improvement coming from HR response to epinephrine. The RNN’s AUCs
computed over titrations characterized as independent application with independent observation were generally higher
than AUCs from the whole set. The only exceptions were dopamine-HR and epinephrine-HR combinations.

DISCUSSION
This is the first attempt to predict an individual critically ill child’s response to increasing or decreasing doses of
vasoactive medications. The complex environment of an ICU, in which the effects of administered interventions and
treatments can vary significantly from what may be observed in a controlled setting, coupled with the complexity of
disease processes, pose significant challenges to developing a robust predictive model.
When defining the response (i.e. vital sign change from pre-titration to post-titration), we deemed a one hour postobservation window sufficient for understanding the vasoactive’s effects beyond a child’s immediate response to the
titration. We also believed the two hour pre-observation window provided more complete information of the child’s
hemodynamic state before titration to compare with their altered state after titration.
The responses to dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine titrations in CHLA’s PICU showed significant heterogeneity, consistent with observations from a prior study1 and the notion that many factors about patient condition
affect the response. These results were reflected in the low correlation coefficients between the observed responses
and dose changes, regardless of the vasoactive-vital sign combination (Figure 3). Not surprisingly, the linear regression model using only titration information performed poorly in MAE (Table 3) and AUC (Table 4), where the latter
corresponds to the task of determining positive or negative physiologic response.
The RNN model, which used all available variables, showed some improvements. Across all vasoactive-vital combinations, the observed responses were more highly correlated to the RNN’s predictions than they were to dose changes.
The RNN’s predictions of all four vital responses to dopamine and epinephrine dose changes showed MAE and AUC
improvements over the LR model, while the RNN’s predictions of SBP, DBP, and MAP responses to norepinephrine
titrations were worse than the regression model’s. This is potentially due to the limited norepinephrine data available
for training. These results indicate that the RNN model had some ability to extract factors, in addition to vasoactive
dose change, that affect response. Both the LR and RNN models performed better on the subset of titrations characterized as independent application with independent observation than on the whole set. This was true for MAEs

on all vasoactive-vital combinations, and for AUCs on all but two vasoactive-vital combinations. This affirms our
assumption that this subset of titrations would provide a “cleaner” dataset for understanding the effects of vasoactives,
despite the true responses for this subset still showing similar heterogeneity to the full data set.
Future efforts to improve model development include incorporating monitor data and more detailed fluids data. Monitor data captures patient vital sign observations with much higher temporal frequency than the charted data used in
this study. Higher fidelity data may provide a more complete picture of a patient’s hemodynamic state during any
observation window, thus enabling more accurate response computations. In turn, these may allow for better model
development. Detailed data for all fluids administered may also improve RNN performance. Fluids are typically administered first before vasoactives to improve blood pressure in septic children, and thus are an important intervention
to include in any model.
CONCLUSION
Septic children’s responses to vasoactive titrations displayed significant heterogeneity, which indicates that variables
other than dose titration affect the response. We hypothesized that an RNN would be able to process variables and their
interactions to more accurately predict an individual child’s response than a linear regression using titration data alone.
The analysis assessing and comparing the performance of the two models supported this hypothesis. While the RNN’s
predictions are not yet clinically applicable, the methodologies developed here may provide an initial framework to
refine machine learning models for this problem. Further development of these methodologies may assist clinical
administration of vasoactive medications in children with septic shock in the future.
