Abstract—Cardiac auscultation involves expert interpretation
of abnormalities in heart sounds using stethoscope. Deep learning based cardiac auscultation is of significant interest to the
healthcare community as it can help reducing the burden of
manual auscultation with automated detection of abnormal heartbeats. However, the problem of automatic cardiac auscultation
is complicated due to the requirement of reliability and high
accuracy, and due to the presence of background noise in the
heartbeat sound. In this work, we propose a Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) based automated cardiac auscultation solution.
Our choice of RNNs is motivated by the great success of deep
learning in medical applications and by the observation that
RNNs represent the deep learning configuration most suitable for
dealing with sequential or temporal data even in the presence
of noise. We explore the use of various RNN models, and
demonstrate that these models deliver the abnormal heartbeat
classification score with significant improvement. Our proposed
approach using RNNs can be potentially be used for real-time
abnormal heartbeat detection in the Internet of Medical Things
for remote monitoring applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem and have been the leading cause of death globally.
They are causing nearly 48% deaths in Europe [1], 34.3%
in America [2], and more than 75% in developing countries
[3]. Earlier diagnosis of CVDs is crucial as it can drastically
decrease the potential risk factors of these deaths [4].
Auscultation is an widely used method for CVD diagnosis,
which uses stethoscope to find out clues of different cardiac
abnormalities. However, it requires extensive training and experience for proper auscultating [5]. Only 20 to 40% accuracy
can be achieved when performed by medical students and
primary care physicians [6], [7], and roughly 80% can be
achieved when conducted by expert cardiologists [8], [9].
Another effective solution is echocardiograms that visualize
the heart beating and blood pumping. However, this procedure
is expensive with an average cost of $1500 as per current cost
[10]. Overall, there is a distinctive lack of a reliable yet costeffective tool for earlier diagnosis of CVD.
A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is
a sensor-enabled automated diagnosis in real-time using mobile devices and cloud computing [11], [12]. In fact, this
has inspired the development of phonocardiography (PCG),
which is now an effective and non-invasive method for earlier
detection of cardiac abnormality [13]. In PCG, heart sound

is recorded from the chest wall using a digital stethoscope
and this sound is analyzed to detect whether the heart is
functioning normally or the patient should be referred to
an expert for further diagnosis. Due to its high potential,
automatic detection of cardiac abnormalities through PCG
signal is a rapidly growing field of research [14]. Most of
these automated cardiac auscultation attempts, however, have
utilized either classical machine learning models (e.g., [15]–
[18]) or feed-forward neural networks [19], [20] rather than
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)—which are intrinsically
better suited for this task.
Heart sound is a physiologic time series and it possesses
temporal dynamics that change based on the different heart
symptoms. Due to their well-known capabilities for modeling
and analyzing sequential data even in the presence of noise
[21], in this paper we explore various RNNs for automated
cardiac auscultation. We use 2016 PhysioNet Computing in
Cardiology Challenge dataset [22] that contains phonocardiograms recorded using sensors placed at the four common
locations of human body: pulmonic area, aortic area, mitral
area, and tricuspid area. The work presented in this study is
the first attempt that investigates the performance of various
state-of-the-art RNNs for heartbeat classification using PCG
signals.
II. R ELATED W ORK
In the past few years, automatic analysis of phonocardiogram (PCG), which refers to the high-fidelity sound recording
of murmurs made by the heart, has been widely studied
especially for automated heartbeat segmentation and classification. According to Liu et al. [22] there was no existing
study that applied deep learning for automatic analysis on
heartbeat before the 2016 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology
Challenge. Now there are few attempts using deep learning
models for classifying normal and abnormal heart sounds,
which we describe next.
A deep learning based approach was used in [23] for
automatic recognition of abnormal heartbeat using a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The authors computed
a two-dimensional heat map from one-dimensional time series of PCG signal with the overlapping segment length of
T = 3 seconds and used for training and validation of the
model. They achieved the highest specificity score 0.9521

2

as compared to all entries made in PhysioNet Computing in
Cardiology challenge but their sensitivity and accuracy scores
were low: 0.7278 and 0.8399, respectively.
A fully connected neural network (NN) consisting of 15
hidden layers was used in [20] for the classification of PCG
signals. The authors achieved the recognition rate of 80% with
the specificity of 82 and poor sensitivity of 63. Potes et al. [24]
used an ensemble of AdaBoost and the CNN classifiers to
classify normal/abnormal heartbeats. This ensemble approach
achieved the highest score in the among others and achieved
rank one in the competition with the specificity, sensitivity,
and overall score of 0.7781, 0.9424, and 0.8602, respectively.
Other approaches in this challenge were based on the classical
machine learning based classifiers. Interestingly, none of the
above studies have attempted RNN, which is, however, the
most powerful model for time series data.
RNN architectures such as Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) have not been
used for PCG analysis but they have achieved state-of-the-art
performances in various other applications with sequential data
including speech recognition [25], [26], machine translation
[27], [28], and emotion detection [29]. Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) [30], which processes the
information in both directions with two different LSTM layers
show even better performance than LSTM and other conventional RNNs in phoneme classification and recognition [31].
Moreover, Deep BLSTMs with the objective function of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) are very effective in
optimizing word error rate in speech recognition system with
no prior linguistic or lexicon information [32]. Bidirectional
Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) have also been used for
audio processing. They achieved a significant improvement in
the performance of sound events detection from the recording
of real-life, by capturing their temporal boundaries [33].
III. P ROPOSED A PPROACH AND RNN M ODELS
Our proposed approach for heart sound classification using
RNNs is depicted in Figure 1. The heart sound is first
prepossessed for first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2,
respectively) detection and segmented into smaller chunks.
Features extracted from these segments are given to the
RNNs for classification, which classifies these into normal or
abnormal.

grid-like structures, such as, images. It takes an input sequence
x(t) = (x1 , ....., xT ) and at the current time step t calculates
the hidden state or memory of the network ht using previous
hidden state ht−1 and the input xt . The outputs from RNN
are projected to the number of classes. A softmax function is
used to project the output vector into the probability vector
having values in [0,1]. When RNNs are used for abnormal
heartbeat detection, its end layer is projected to the number
of classes (normal and abnormal). Given a series of heart
signal x(t) = (x1 , ....., xT ), an RNN classifier learn to predict
hypotheses ŷ of true label y. The standard equations for RNN
is given below:
ht = H(Wxh xt + Whh ht−1 + bh )

(1)

yt = (Wxh xt + by )

(2)

where W terms are the weight matrices (i.e., Wxh is weight
matrix of an input-hidden layer), b is the bias vector and H
denotes the hidden layer function.
1) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Units: The LSTM
[21] network is a special type of RNN that consists of a
recurrent memory block to store representations for extended
time intervals. A memory block consists of three gates: input,
output and forget gate. These multiplicative gates learn to
control the constant error flow within each memory cell. The
memory cell decides what to store, and when to enable reads,
writes and erasures of information. Graphical representation
of LSTM memory cell is shown in Figure 2a.
When features from a sequence of heart signal are given to
the network, each LSTM unit holds a memory ct at a specific
time t. The activation function is given by:
ht = ot tanh(ct )

(3)

The output gate ot modulates the memory content and calculated by:

ot = σ Wxo xt + Who ht−1 + Wco ct + bo
(4)
The forget gate ft control the memory in the network and
update it by forgetting the existing memory ct with the
incoming information.

ft = σ Wxf xt + Whf ht−1 + Wcf ct + bf
(5)
The extent of incoming information is controlled by the input
gate it

it = σ Wif xt + Whi ht−1 + Wci ct + bi
(6)
The existing memory in the network is finally updated by the
following equation under the control of these three gates.

ct = ft ct−1 + it tanh Wxc xt + Whc ht−1 + bc

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are specialized to process sequences, unlike the CNNs, which are specialized for

2) Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): The Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) [27] is a slightly simplified version of LSTM
that combines the input and forget gates into a single gate
known as update gate. GRU architecture has an additional reset
gate as compared to LSTM (see Figure 2b). GRUs control the
information flow from the previous activation while computing
candidate activation but unlike LSTM do not control the
amount of incoming memory using the forget gate.

B. Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks
One shortcoming of standard RNNs is that they can only
use previous information for making decisions. Bidirectional
RNNs [30] using LSTM units or GRUs can process the
information both in the forward and backward direction which
enable them to exploit future context. This is achieved by com→
−
puting the hidden sequence both in forward h and backward
←
−
direction h , and updating the output layer using backward
layer from time step t = T to 1 and forward layer from t = 1
to T (see Figure 2c).
Similarly, a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) exploits the full
use of contextual information and produces two sequences
[hf1 , hf2 , ....., hfT ] and [hb1 , hb2 , ....., hbT ] by processing the information both in forward and backward directions, respectively.
These two sequences are concatenated at the output by the
following equation:
←−−→
GRU (X) = |hf1 ||hbT , ..., hfT ||hb1 |.
(8)
←−−→
Here, the GRU (X) term represents the full output of BiGRU
produced by concatenating each state in forward direction hfi
and backward direction hb(T −i+1) at step i given the input X.
In this paper, we use both RNNs and bidirectional RNNs and
compare their performances on abnormal heartbeat detection.
IV. E XPERIMENTAL P ROCEDURE
The performance of different RNN models is evaluated on
the publicly available datasets. The details of the datasets and
experimental procedure are presented in this section.
A. Database Description
To evaluate the proposed methodology, the largest dataset
provided at the “Physionet Challenge 2016” [22] has been
used. The Physionet dataset consists of six databases (A
through F) containing a total of 3240 raw heart sound recordings. These recordings were independently collected by different research teams using heterogeneous sensing equipment
from different countries both in clinical and nonclinical (i.e.,
home visits) settings. The dataset contains both clean and
noisy heart sound recordings. The recordings were collected
both from healthy subjects and patients with a variety of heart
conditions, especially coronary artery disease and heart valve

disease. The subjects were from different age groups including
children, adults and elderly. The length of heart sound recordings varied from 5 seconds to just over 120 seconds. For our
experiments, we use all six databases containing normal and
abnormal heart sound recordings.
B. Preprocessing of Heart Sound
The heart sound recorded by electronic stethoscope often
has background noise. The preprocessing of heart sound is an
essential and crucial step for automatic analysis of heartbeat
recordings. It reveals the inherent physiological structure of the
heart signal by detecting the abnormalities in the meaningful
regions of PCG signal and allows for the automatic recognition
of pathological events. The detection of the exact locations
of the first and second heart sounds (i.e., S1 and S2) within
PCG is known as the segmentation process. The main goal of
this process is to ensure that incoming heartbeats are properly
aligned before their classification as it significantly improves
the recognition scores [34].
In this paper, we used state-of-the-art method Logistic
Regression-Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM) for identification of heart states proposed by Springer et al. [35]. This
method uses LR-derived emission or observation probability
estimates and provides significantly improved results as compared to the previous approaches based on the Gaussian or
Gamma distributions [36], [37].
The working of Logistic Regression-HSMM is similar to
SVM based emission probabilities [38] and it allows for
greater discrimination between different states. Logistic regression is a binary classifier that maps the feature space or
predictor variables to the binary response variables by using
a logistic function. The logistic function σ(a) is defined as:
σ(a) =

1
1 + exp (−a)

(9)

The probability of a state or class given the input observations
Ot can be defined using the logistic function:


0
(10)
P qt = ξ|Ot = σ(w Ot ).
The term w represents the weights of the model that are
applied to each observation or input features. The model
is trained iteratively and re-weighted least squares on the

4

training data. For one-vs-all logistic regression, the probability
of each observation given the state bj (Ot |ξj ) is found by using
Bayes’rule:




 P qt = ξ|Ot × P Ot

bj (Ot ) = P Ot |qt = ξ =
. (11)
P ξj
The P (Ot ) is calculated from a multivariate normal distribution of the entire training data and P (ξj ) is the initial state
probability distribution.
The Logistic Regression-HSMM algorithm use the combination of four type of features: Homomorphic envelope,
Hilbert envelope, Wavelet envelope and Power spectral density
envelope. The details of these features can be seen in [35]. The
overall PCG recordings are given to the model for accurate
detection of most probable states (i.e., S1 and S2).

Figure 3: Four states (S1, S2, systole, and diastole) of the heart
cycle using Logistic Regression-HSMM
Figure 3 shows the detected four states (i.e., S1, S2, systole,
and asystole) of two heart cycles. Note that, generally, it is
called as S1 and S2 detection, although it detects all the four
states: S1, S2, systole, and asystole. The blue line is for the
heart signal and the black line shows the detected states using
Logistic Regression-HSMM algorithm.
C. Segment Extraction
After detecting the position of heart states, we segmented
the overall PCG waveform into shorter instances by locating
the beginning of each heartbeat. This is because the number
of audio recordings (i.e., 3240) of heart signal is not adequate
to evaluate RNNs for designing a robust system. Segment
extraction was also used in previous studies to divide the
overall heart sound in smaller chunks. For instance, Rubin
et al. [23] used a segment of T = 3 seconds for training
and validation of CNN. In this paper, we segmented the
heart signal into three sequences of heart cycles: 2, 5, and 8.
These segments contain enough information and at the same
time small enough to generate many samples for training the
model. Figure 4a & 4b shows the five cycles of normal and
abnormal heart sound, respectively. The abnormal heart sound
is different from the normal one in temporal context. It has
heart cycle states of longer duration in the segment.
D. Feature Selection
The extraction and selection of more relevant parameters
from PCG signals are crucial tasks. They significantly affect

the recognition performance of the model. In this paper we
used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) [39] to
represent PCG signal in compact representation. MFCCs are
used almost in every study on automatic heart sound classification (for example, [24], [40]–[42]) due to their effectiveness
in speech analysis. We compute MFCCs from 25ms of the
window with a step size of 10ms. We select the first 13 MFCCs
for compact representation of PCG signal as a large feature
space does not always improve the recognition rate of the
model [43].
E. Model Parameters
We built our models using Keras [44] with a TensorFlow
backend [45]. In order to find the best models’ structure, we
evaluated a different number of gated layers from one to four.
A smaller model with only one LSTM or GRU layer was
not performing well on this task. Experiments with a larger
number of gated layers and dense layers also failed to give
improvements in performance. This might be due to overfitting
problem. We got the best classification results using 2 gated
layers for both LSTM and GRU models. Therefore, our LSTM
and BLSTM models consist of two LSTM layer with tanh
function [46] as activation. For each heartbeat, the outputs of
LSTM or BLSTM layers were given to the dense layer and
the outputs of this layer were given to the softmax layer for
classification (refer to Section III).
We trained all these models using the training portion of
the dataset and development portion of the data was used
for hyper-parameter selection. We started training the network
with a learning rate of 0.002 and learning rate was halved
after every 5 epochs if the classification rate of the model did
not improve on the validation set. This process continued until
the learning rate reached below 0.00001 or until the maximum
epochs i.e., 100 were reached. We used batch normalization after the dense layer for normalization of learned distribution to
improve the training efficiency [47]. In order to accommodate
the effect of initialization, we repeated each hyperparameter
combination for three times and used the averaged prediction
for validation and testing.
V. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
The overall dataset of PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology
Challenge consisted of eight heart sound databases gathered
from seven different countries. There is a total of 3240 publicly
available heartbeat recordings. We detected heart states in
each PCG waveform and segmented these signals into smaller
chunks containing exact five heart cycles. MFCCs were computed from these chunks and both models were trained on
75% of data, 15% data was used for validation and remaining
10% of data was used for testing. As each model was trained
on MFCC computed from the smaller segment, to predict
the score for full instance, an averaging was performed on
posterior probabilities of the respective chunks. In this work,
the accuracy of RNNs has been tested on three different cycles:
2, 5, and 8 in a heart signal (see Figure 5). All RNN models
consistently performed well on 5 cycles. Therefore, onward
we mention results using 5 cycles.

A. Baseline models
In order to compare the performance of RNNs, we selected
three classic powerful classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)
as baseline models. We trained these models on MFCCs
computed from 5 heart cycles. In SVM, we tested three
kernels: linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF)
to obtain the best classification results. Hyperparameters of
these models were selected using validation data. Table I
shows the best results obtained by these models and presents
a comparison with RNNs. We observe RNNs significantly
outperform all three models in every performance measures.

be clearly noticed that RNNs outperform all deep learning
models used on heart sound classification with a significant
improvement. Worth mentioning, heart sound classification
using the ensemble of AdaBoost and CNN achieved “Rank
1” in PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016
with the best recognition rate. In our approach, RNNs using
LSTM and even with GRUs have achieved better recognition
rate than that in every performance measures.
C. Performance Comparison of RNNs
In this study, our evaluation focused on the sequence modeling of heart sound using RNNs. We explored the performance
of different state-of-the-art RNNs for this task. Based on the
experimental results, it can be highlighted that the different
RNNs have achieved comparable performances. However, out
of all models, BLSTMs perform consistently well and is
preferred for heartbeat classification using PCG. Another important finding, despite having a simpler architecture compared
to LSTM, the performance of GRU is also promising on PCG
data.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on abnormal heartbeat detection using PCG signal and demonstrate

that Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) produce promising
results. In particular, the results are significantly better than
the conventional deep learning models. RNNs have the most
important architectures to capture the temporal statistics and
dynamics in the sequence of heartbeats more efficiently as
compared to the other popular DNNs like CNN. Noteworthy,
the RNN models significantly outperform the AdaBoost-CNN
model which was placed Rank 1 in the PhysioNet Computing
in Cardiology Challenge 2016. In our future studies, we aim
to produce further empirical evidences of why RNNs are
promising for heartbeat classification.
