cardiac auscultation involves expert interpretation
of abnormalities in heart sounds using stethoscope. deep learning based cardiac auscultation is of significant interest to the
healthcare community as it can help reducing the burden of
manual auscultation with automated detection of abnormal heartbeats. however, the problem of automatic cardiac auscultation
is complicated due to the requirement of reliability and high
accuracy, and due to the presence of background noise in the
heartbeat sound. in this work, we propose a recurrent neural
networks (rnns) based automated cardiac auscultation solution.
our choice of rnns is motivated by the great success of deep
learning in medical applications and by the observation that
rnns represent the deep learning configuration most suitable for
dealing with sequential or temporal data even in the presence
of noise. we explore the use of various rnn models, and
demonstrate that these models deliver the abnormal heartbeat
classification score with significant improvement. our proposed
approach using rnns can be potentially be used for real-time
abnormal heartbeat detection in the internet of medical things
for remote monitoring applications.
