we introduce a novel playlist generation algorithm that focuses on the quality of transitions using a recurrent neural
network (rnn). the proposed model assumes that optimal
transitions between tracks can be modelled and predicted by
internal transitions within music tracks. we introduce modelling sequences of high-level music descriptors using rnns
and discuss an experiment involving different similarity functions, where the sequences are provided by a musical structural analysis algorithm. qualitative observations show that
the proposed approach can effectively model transitions of
music tracks in playlists.
