this paper has been accepted by ieee transactions
on geoscience and remote sensing. by considering the spectral
signature as a sequence, recurrent neural networks (rnns) have
been successfully used to learn discriminative features from
hyperspectral images (hsis) recently. however, most of these
models only input the whole spectral bands into rnns directly,
which may not fully explore the specific properties of hsis. in this
paper, we propose a cascaded rnn model using gated recurrent
units (grus) to explore the redundant and complementary
information of hsis. it mainly consists of two rnn layers.
the first rnn layer is used to eliminate redundant information
between adjacent spectral bands, while the second rnn layer
aims to learn the complementary information from non-adjacent
spectral bands. to improve the discriminative ability of the
learned features, we design two strategies for the proposed model.
besides, considering the rich spatial information contained in
hsis, we further extend the proposed model to its spectral-spatial
counterpart by incorporating some convolutional layers. to test
the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct experiments
on two widely used hsis. the experimental results show that our
proposed models can achieve better results than the compared
models.
