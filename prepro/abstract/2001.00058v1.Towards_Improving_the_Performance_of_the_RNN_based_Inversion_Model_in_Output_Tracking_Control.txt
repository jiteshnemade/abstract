 with the advantages of high modeling accuracy
and large bandwidth, recurrent neural network (rnn) based
inversion model control has been proposed for output tracking.
however, some issues still need to be addressed when using
the rnn-based inversion model. first, with limited number
of parameters in rnn, it cannot model the low-frequency
dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model has been
used, which can become an interference for tracking control
at high frequencies. moreover, the control speed and the rnn
modeling accuracy cannot be improved simultaneously as the
control sampling speed is restricted by the length of the rnn
training set. therefore, this article focuses on addressing these
limitations of rnn-based inversion model control. specifically,
a novel modeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear
model in a way that it does not affect the existing highfrequency control performance achieved by rnn. additionally,
an interpolation method is proposed to double the sampling
frequency (compared to the rnn training sampling frequency).
analysis on the stability issues which may arise when the
proposed new model is used for predictive control is presented
along with the instructions on determining the parameters
for ensuring the closed-loop stability. finally, the proposed
approach is demonstrated on a commercial piezo actuator, and
the experiment results show that the tracking performances can
be significantly improved.
