recurrent neural networks (rnns) are non-linear dynamic systems. previous
work believes that rnn may suffer from the phenomenon of chaos, where the
system is sensitive to initial states and unpredictable in the long run. in this paper,
however, we perform a systematic empirical analysis, showing that a vanilla or
long short term memory (lstm) rnn does not exhibit chaotic behavior along
the training process in real applications such as text generation. our findings suggest that future work in this direction should address the other side of non-linear
dynamics for rnn.
