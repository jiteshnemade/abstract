objective: predict individual septic children’s personalized physiologic responses to vasoactive titrations by training
a recurrent neural network (rnn) using emr data.
materials and methods: this study retrospectively analyzed emr of patients admitted to a pediatric icu from 2009
to 2017. data included charted time series vitals, labs, drugs, and interventions of children with septic shock treated
with dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. a rnn was trained to predict responses in heart rate (hr), systolic
blood pressure (sbp), diastolic blood pressure (dbp) and mean arterial pressure (map) to 8,640 titrations during 652
septic episodes and evaluated on a holdout set of 3,883 titrations during 254 episodes. a linear regression model using
titration data as its sole input was also developed and compared to the rnn model. evaluation methods included the
correlation coefficient between actual physiologic responses and rnn predictions, mean absolute error (mae), and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc).
results: the actual physiologic responses displayed significant variability and were more accurately predicted by
the rnn model than by titration alone (r = 0.20 vs r = 0.05, p < 0.01). the rnn showed mae and auc
improvements over the linear model. the rnn’s maes associated with dopamine and epinephrine were 1-3% lower
than the linear regression model mae for hr, sbp, dbp, and map. across all vitals vasoactives, the rnn achieved
1-19% auc improvement over the linear model.
discussion: the wide variability of observed responses indicates that many factors other than dose change affect the
response. not surprisingly, a linear model whose sole input is dose change does not adequately capture the physiologic
changes associated with vasoactive titrations, and is no better than chance in predicting individual patient responses.
the rnn model showed improvement over the linear model in predicting titration response.
conclusion: this initial attempt in pediatric critical care to predict individual physiologic responses to vasoactive dose
changes in children with septic shock demonstrated an rnn model showed some improvement over a linear model.
while not yet clinically applicable, further development may assist clinical administration of vasoactive medications
in children with septic shock.
