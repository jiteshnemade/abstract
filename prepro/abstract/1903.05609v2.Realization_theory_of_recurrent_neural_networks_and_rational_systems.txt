 in this paper, we show that, under mild assumptions, input-output behavior of a continuous-time recurrent
neural network (rnn) can be represented by a rational or
polynomial non-linear system. the assumptions concern the
activation function of rnns, and they are satisfied by many
classical activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent.
we also present an algorithm for constructing the polynomial
and rational system. this embedding of rnns into rational
systems can be useful for stability, identifiability, and realization
theory for rnns, as these problems have been studied for polynomial/rational systems. in particular, we use this embedding
for deriving necessary conditions for realizability of an inputoutput map by rnn, and for deriving sufficient conditions for
minimality of an rnn.
