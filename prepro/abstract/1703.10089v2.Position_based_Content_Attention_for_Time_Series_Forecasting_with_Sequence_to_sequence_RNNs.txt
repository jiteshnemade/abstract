 we propose here an extended attention model for sequence-to-sequence
recurrent neural networks (rnns) designed to capture (pseudo-)periods in time
series. this extended attention model can be deployed on top of any rnn and is
shown to yield state-of-the-art performance for time series forecasting on several
univariate and multivariate time series.
