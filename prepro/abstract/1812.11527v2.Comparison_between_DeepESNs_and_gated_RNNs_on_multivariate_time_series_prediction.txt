we propose an experimental comparison between deep
echo state networks (deepesns) and gated recurrent neural networks
(rnns) on multivariate time-series prediction tasks. in particular, we
compare reservoir and fully-trained rnns able to represent signals featured by multiple time-scales dynamics. the analysis is performed in terms
of efficiency and prediction accuracy on 4 polyphonic music tasks. our results show that deepesn is able to outperform esn in terms of prediction
accuracy and efficiency. whereas, between fully-trained approaches, gated
recurrent units (gru) outperforms long short-term memory (lstm)
and simple rnn models in most cases. overall, deepesn turned out
to be extremely more efficient than others rnn approaches and the best
solution in terms of prediction accuracy on 3 out of 4 tasks.
