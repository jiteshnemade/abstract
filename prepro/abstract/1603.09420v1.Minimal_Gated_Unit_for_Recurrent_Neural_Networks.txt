recently recurrent neural networks (rnn) has
been very successful in handling sequence data.
however, understanding rnn and finding the
best practices for rnn is a difficult task, partly
because there are many competing and complex
hidden units (such as lstm and gru). we propose a gated unit for rnn, named as minimal
gated unit (mgu), since it only contains one
gate, which is a minimal design among all gated
hidden units. the design of mgu benefits from
evaluation results on lstm and gru in the literature. experiments on various sequence data
show that mgu has comparable accuracy with
gru, but has a simpler structure, fewer parameters, and faster training. hence, mgu is suitable in rnn’s applications. its simple architecture also means that it is easier to evaluate and
tune, and in principle it is easier to study mgu’s
properties theoretically and empirically.
