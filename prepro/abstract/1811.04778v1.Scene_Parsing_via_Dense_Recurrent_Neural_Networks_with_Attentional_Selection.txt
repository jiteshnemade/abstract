recurrent neural networks (rnns) have shown the ability to improve scene parsing through capturing long-range
dependencies among image units. in this paper, we propose
dense rnns for scene labeling by exploring various longrange semantic dependencies among image units. different
from existing rnn based approaches, our dense rnns are
able to capture richer contextual dependencies for each image unit by enabling immediate connections between each
pair of image units, which significantly enhances their discriminative power. besides, to select relevant dependencies
and meanwhile to restrain irrelevant ones for each unit from
dense connections, we introduce an attention model into
dense rnns. the attention model allows automatically assigning more importance to helpful dependencies while less
weight to unconcerned dependencies. integrating with convolutional neural networks (cnns), we develop an end-toend scene labeling system. extensive experiments on three
large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the baselines by large margins and outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms.
