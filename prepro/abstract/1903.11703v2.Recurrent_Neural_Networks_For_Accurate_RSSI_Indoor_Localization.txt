 this paper proposes recurrent neural networks
(rnns) for wifi fingerprinting indoor localization. instead of
locating a mobile userâ€™s position one at a time as in the cases
of conventional algorithms, our rnn solution aims at trajectory
positioning and takes into account the correlation among the
received signal strength indicator (rssi) measurements in a trajectory. to enhance the accuracy among the temporal fluctuations
of rssi, a weighted average filter is proposed for both input
rssi data and sequential output locations. the results using
different types of rnn including vanilla rnn, long short-term
memory (lstm), gated recurrent unit (gru), bidirectional rnn
(birnn), bidirectional lstm (bilstm) and bidirectional gru
(bigru) are presented. on-site experiments demonstrate that
the proposed structure achieves an average localization error
of 0.75 m with 80% of the errors under one meter, which
outperforms knn algorithms and probabilistic algorithms by
approximately 30% under the same test environment.
