in neural image captioning systems, a recurrent neural network (rnn) is typically viewed
as the primary ‘generation’ component. this
view suggests that the image features should
be ‘injected’ into the rnn. this is in fact the
dominant view in the literature. alternatively,
the rnn can instead be viewed as only encoding the previously generated words. this
view suggests that the rnn should only be
used to encode linguistic features and that only
the final representation should be ‘merged’
with the image features at a later stage. this
paper compares these two architectures. we
find that, in general, late merging outperforms injection, suggesting that rnns are better viewed as encoders, rather than generators.
