 in this paper, we introduce new methods and discuss results
of text-based lstm (long short-term memory) networks for automatic
music composition. the proposed network is designed to learn relationships within text documents that represent chord progressions and drum
tracks in two case studies. in the experiments, word-rnns (recurrent
neural networks) show good results for both cases, while character-based
rnns (char-rnns) only succeed to learn chord progressions. the proposed system can be used for fully automatic composition or as semiautomatic systems that help humans to compose music by controlling a
diversity parameter of the model.
