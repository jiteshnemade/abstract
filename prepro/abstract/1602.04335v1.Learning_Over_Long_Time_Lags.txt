the advantage of recurrent neural networks (rnns) in learning dependencies between time-series data has
distinguished rnns from other deep learning models. recently, many advances are proposed in this emerging
field. however, there is a lack of comprehensive review on memory models in rnns in the literature. this
paper provides a fundamental review on rnns and long short term memory (lstm) model. then, provides a
surveys of recent advances in different memory enhancements and learning techniques for capturing long term
dependencies in rnns.
keywords: long-short term memory, long-term dependency, recurrent neural networks, time-series data.
