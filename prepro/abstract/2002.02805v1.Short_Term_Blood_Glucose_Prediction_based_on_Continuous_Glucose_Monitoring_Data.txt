 continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) has enabled important opportunities for diabetes management. this
study explores the use of cgm data as input for digital decision
support tools. we investigate how recurrent neural networks
(rnns) can be used for short term blood glucose (stbg)
prediction and compare the rnns to conventional time-series
forecasting using autoregressive integrated moving average
(arima). a prediction horizon up to 90 min into the future is
considered. in this context, we evaluate both population-based
and patient-specific rnns and contrast them to patient-specific
arima models and a simple baseline predicting future observations as the last observed. we find that the population-based
rnn model is the best performing model across the considered
prediction horizons without the need of patient-specific data.
this demonstrates the potential of rnns for stbg prediction
in diabetes patients towards detecting/mitigating severe events
in the stbg, in particular hypoglycemic events. however,
further studies are needed in regards to the robustness and
practical use of the investigated stbg prediction models.
