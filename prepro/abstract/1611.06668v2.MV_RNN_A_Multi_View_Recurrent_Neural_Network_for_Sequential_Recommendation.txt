sequential recommendation is a fundamental task for network applications, and it usually suffers from the item cold start
problem due to the insufficiency of user feedbacks. there are currently three kinds of popular approaches which are respectively based
on matrix factorization (mf) of collaborative filtering, markov chain (mc), and recurrent neural network (rnn). although widely used,
they have some limitations. mf based methods could not capture dynamic user’s interest. the strong markov assumption greatly limits
the performance of mc based methods. rnn based methods are still in the early stage of incorporating additional information. based
on these basic models, many methods with additional information only validate incorporating one modality in a separate way. in this
work, to make the sequential recommendation and deal with the item cold start problem, we propose a multi-view rrecurrent neural
network (mv-rnn) model. given the latent feature, mv-rnn can alleviate the item cold start problem by incorporating visual and
textual information. first, at the input of mv-rnn, three different combinations of multi-view features are studied, like concatenation,
fusion by addition and fusion by reconstructing the original multi-modal data. mv-rnn applies the recurrent structure to dynamically
capture the user’s interest. second, we design a separate structure and a united structure on the hidden state of mv-rnn to explore a
more effective way to handle multi-view features. experiments on two real-world datasets show that mv-rnn can effectively generate
the personalized ranking list, tackle the missing modalities problem and significantly alleviate the item cold start problem.
