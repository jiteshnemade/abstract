 the problem of varying dynamics of tracked objects, such as
pedestrians, is traditionally tackled with approaches like the interacting
multiple model (imm) filter using a bayesian formulation. by following
the current trend towards using deep neural networks, in this paper an
rnn-based imm filter surrogate is presented. similar to an imm filter
solution, the presented rnn-based model assigns a probability value
to a performed dynamic and, based on them, puts out a multi-modal
distribution over future pedestrian trajectories. the evaluation is done
on synthetic data, reflecting prototypical pedestrian maneuvers.
