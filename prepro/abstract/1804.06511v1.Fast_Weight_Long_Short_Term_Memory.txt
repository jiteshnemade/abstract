associative memory using fast weights is a short-term memory mechanism that
substantially improves the memory capacity and time scale of recurrent neural
networks (rnns). as recent studies introduced fast weights only to regular rnns,
it is unknown whether fast weight memory is beneficial to gated rnns. in this
work, we report a significant synergy between long short-term memory (lstm)
networks and fast weight associative memories. we show that this combination,
in learning associative retrieval tasks, results in much faster training and lower test
error, a performance boost most prominent at high memory task difficulties.
