recurrent neural network (rnn) is an effective neural network in solving very
complex supervised and unsupervised tasks. there has been a significant
improvement in rnn field such as natural language processing, speech processing,
computer vision and other multiple domains. this paper deals with rnn
application on different use cases like incident detection, fraud detection, and
android malware classification. the best performing neural network architecture
is chosen by conducting different chain of experiments for different network
parameters and structures. the network is run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate
set in the range of 0.01 to 0.5.obviously, rnn performed very well when
compared to classical machine learning algorithms. this is mainly possible
because rnns implicitly extracts the underlying features and also identifies the
characteristics of the data. this helps to achieve better accuracy.
