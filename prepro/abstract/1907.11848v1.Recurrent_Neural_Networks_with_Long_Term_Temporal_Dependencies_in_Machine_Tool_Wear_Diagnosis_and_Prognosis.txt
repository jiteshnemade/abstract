data-driven approaches to automated machine condition monitoring are gaining popularity due to
advancements made in sensing technologies and computing algorithms. this paper proposes the use of a
deep learning model, based on long short-term memory (lstm) architecture for a recurrent neural
network (rnn) which captures long term dependencies for modeling sequential data. in the context of
estimating cutting tool wear amounts, this lstm based rnn approach utilizes a system transition and
system observation function based on a minimally intrusive vibration sensor signal located near the
workpiece fixtures. by applying an lstm based rnn, the method helps to avoid building an analytic
model for specific tool wear machine degradation, overcoming the assumptions made by hidden markov
models, kalman filter, and particle filter based approaches. the proposed approach is tested using
experiments performed on a milling machine. we have demonstrated one-step and two-step look ahead
cutting tool state prediction using online indirect measurements obtained from vibration signals.
additionally, the study also estimates remaining useful life (rul) of a machine cutting tool insert
through generative rnn. the experimental results show that our approach, applying the lstm to model
system observation and transition function is able to outperform the functions modeled with a simple
rnn.
