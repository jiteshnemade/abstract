due to their prevalence, time series forecasting is crucial in multiple domains. we seek to make
state-of-the-art forecasting fast, accessible, and generalizable. es-rnn is a hybrid between classical state space forecasting models and modern rnns that achieved a 9.4% smape improvement
in the m4 competition. crucially, es-rnn implementation requires per-time series parameters.
by vectorizing the original implementation and porting the algorithm to a gpu, we achieve up
to 322x training speedup depending on batch size with similar results as those reported in the
original submission. our code can be found at: https://github.com/damitkwr/esrnn-gpu
