recurrent neural networks (rnns) are now widely used on sequence generation tasks due to their ability to
learn long-range dependencies and to generate sequences of arbitrary length. however, their left-to-right generation
procedure only allows a limited control from a potential user which makes them unsuitable for interactive and creative
usages such as interactive music generation.
this paper introduces a novel architecture called anticipation-rnn which possesses the assets of the rnn-based
generative models while allowing to enforce user-defined positional constraints. we demonstrate its efficiency on the
task of generating melodies satisfying positional constraints in the style of the soprano parts of the j.s. bach chorale
harmonizations.
sampling using the anticipation-rnn is of the same order of complexity than sampling from the traditional rnn
model. this fast and interactive generation of musical sequences opens ways to devise real-time systems that could
be used for creative purposes.
