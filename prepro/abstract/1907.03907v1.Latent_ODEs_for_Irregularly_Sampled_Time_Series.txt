time series with non-uniform intervals occur in many applications, and are difficult to model using standard recurrent neural networks (rnns). we generalize
rnns to have continuous-time hidden dynamics defined by ordinary differential
equations (odes), a model we call ode-rnns. furthermore, we use ode-rnns
to replace the recognition network of the recently-proposed latent ode model.
both ode-rnns and latent odes can naturally handle arbitrary time gaps between observations, and can explicitly model the probability of observation times
using poisson processes. we show experimentally that these ode-based models
outperform their rnn-based counterparts on irregularly-sampled data.
