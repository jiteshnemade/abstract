deep recurrent neural network (rnn) has gained
popularity in many sequence classification tasks. beyond predicting a correct class for each data instance, data scientists
also want to understand what differentiating factors in the data
have contributed to the classification during the learning process.
we present a visual analytics approach to facilitate this task by
revealing the rnn attention for all data instances, their temporal
positions in the sequences, and the attribution of variables at each
value level. we demonstrate with real-world datasets that our
approach can help data scientists to understand such dynamics
in deep rnns from the training results, hence guiding their
modeling process.
