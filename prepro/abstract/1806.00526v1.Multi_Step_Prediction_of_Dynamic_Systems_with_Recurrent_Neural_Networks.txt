recurrent neural networks (rnns) can encode rich
dynamics which makes them suitable for modeling dynamic
systems. to train an rnn for multi-step prediction of dynamic
systems, it is crucial to efficiently address the state initialization
problem, which seeks proper values for the rnn initial states
at the beginning of each prediction interval. in this work, the
state initialization problem is addressed using neural networks
(nns) to effectively train a variety of rnns for modeling two
aerial vehicles, a helicopter and a quadrotor, from experimental
data. it is shown that the rnn initialized by the nn-based
initialization method outperforms the state of the art. further, a
comprehensive study of rnns trained for multi-step prediction
of the two aerial vehicles is presented. the multi-step prediction
of the quadrotor is enhanced using a hybrid model which
combines a simplified physics-based motion model of the vehicle
with rnns. while the maximum translational and rotational
velocities in the quadrotor dataset are about 4 m/s and 3.8
rad/s, respectively, the hybrid model produces predictions, over
1.9 second, which remain within 9 cm/s and 0.12 rad/s of
the measured translational and rotational velocities, with 99%
confidence on the test dataset.
