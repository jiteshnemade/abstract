recurrent neural networks (rnns) are powerful
constructs capable of modeling complex systems, up to and
including turing machines. however, learning such complex
models from finite training sets can be difficult. in this paper
we empirically show that rnns can learn models of computer
peripheral devices through input and output state observation.
this enables automated development of functional software-only
models of hardware devices. such models are applicable to any
number of tasks, including device validation, driver development,
code de-obfuscation, and reverse engineering. we show that the
same rnn structure successfully models six different devices
from simple test circuits up to a 16550 uart serial port, and
verify that these models are capable of producing equivalent
output to real hardware.
