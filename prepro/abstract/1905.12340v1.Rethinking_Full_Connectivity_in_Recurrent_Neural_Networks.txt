recurrent neural networks (rnns) are omnipresent in sequence modeling tasks.
practical models usually consist of several layers of hundreds or thousands of
neurons which are fully connected. this places a heavy computational and memory
burden on hardware, restricting adoption in practical low-cost and low-power
devices. compared to fully convolutional models, the costly sequential operation
of rnns severely hinders performance on parallel hardware. this paper challenges
the convention of full connectivity in rnns. we study structurally sparse rnns,
showing that they are well suited for acceleration on parallel hardware, with a
greatly reduced cost of the recurrent operations as well as orders of magnitude
less recurrent weights. extensive experiments on challenging tasks ranging from
language modeling and speech recognition to video action recognition reveal that
structurally sparse rnns achieve competitive performance as compared to fullyconnected networks. this allows for using large sparse rnns for a wide range of
real-world tasks that previously were too costly with fully connected networks.
