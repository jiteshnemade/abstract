generating eye diagrams by using a circuit simulator can be very computationally intensive, especially in the
presence of nonlinearities. it often involves multiple newton-like
iterations at every time step when a spice-like circuit simulator
handles a nonlinear system in the transient regime. in this
paper, we leverage machine learning methods, to be specific, the
recurrent neural network (rnn), to generate black-box macromodels and achieve significant reduction of computation time.
through the proposed approach, an rnn model is first trained
and then validated on a relatively short sequence generated
from a circuit simulator. once the training completes, the rnn
can be used to make predictions on the remaining sequence in
order to generate an eye diagram. the training cost can also
be amortized when the trained rnn starts making predictions.
besides, the proposed approach requires no complex circuit
simulations nor substantial domain knowledge. we use two highspeed link examples to demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides adequate accuracy while the computation time can be
dramatically reduced. in the high-speed link example with a
pam4 driver, the eye diagram generated by rnn models shows
good agreement with that obtained from a commercial circuit
simulator. this paper also investigates the impacts of various
rnn topologies, training schemes, and tunable parameters on
both the accuracy and the generalization capability of an rnn
model. it is found out that the long short-term memory (lstm)
network outperforms the vanilla rnn in terms of the accuracy
in predicting transient waveforms.
