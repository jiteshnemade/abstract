despite recent innovations in network architectures and loss functions, training rnns to
learn long-term dependencies remains difficult
due to challenges with gradient-based optimisation methods. inspired by the success of
deep neuroevolution in reinforcement learning (such et al., 2017), we explore the use of
gradient-free population-based global optimisation (pbo) techniques â€“ training rnns to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data.
testing evolution strategies (es) and particle
swarm optimisation (pso) on an application in
volatility forecasting, we demonstrate that pbo
methods lead to performance improvements in
general, with es exhibiting the most consistent
results across a variety of architectures.
