most of neural approaches to relation classification have focused on finding short
patterns that represent the semantic relation using convolutional neural networks
(cnns) and those approaches have generally achieved better performances than using recurrent neural networks (rnns).
in a similar intuition to the cnn models,
we propose a novel rnn-based model that
strongly focuses on only important parts of
a sentence using multiple range-restricted
bidirectional layers and attention for relation classification. experimental results
on the semeval-2010 relation classification task show that our model is comparable to the state-of-the-art cnn-based and
rnn-based models that use additional linguistic information.
