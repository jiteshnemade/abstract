session-based recurrent neural networks (rnns) are gaining increasing popularity for recommendation task, due to the high autocorrelation of userâ€™s behavior on the latest session and the effectiveness of rnn to capture the sequence order information. however,
most existing session-based rnn recommender systems still solely
focus on the short-term interactions within a single session and
completely discard all the other long-term data across different
sessions. while traditional collaborative filtering (cf) methods
have many advanced research works on exploring long-term dependency, which show great value to be explored and exploited in
deep learning models. therefore, in this paper, we propose asars,
a novel framework that effectively imports the temporal dynamics
methodology in cf into session-based rnn system in dl, such
that the temporal info can act as scalable weights by a parallel
attentional network. specifically, we first conduct an extensive data
analysis to show the distribution and importance of such temporal
interactions data both within sessions and across sessions. and
then, our asars framework promotes two novel models: (1) an
inter-session temporal dynamic model that captures the long-term
user interaction for rnn recommender system. we integrate the
time changes in session rnn and add user preferences as model
drifting; and (2) a novel triangle parallel attention network that enhances the original rnn model by incorporating time information.
such triangle parallel network is also specially designed for realizing data argumentation in sequence-to-scalar rnn architecture,
and thus it can be trained very efficiently. our extensive experiments on four real datasets from different domains demonstrate the
effectiveness and large improvement of asars for personalized
recommendation.
