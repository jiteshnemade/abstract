gesture recognition is a very essential technology
for many wearable devices. while previous algorithms are mostly
based on statistical methods including the hidden markov model,
we develop two dynamic hand gesture recognition techniques using low complexity recurrent neural network (rnn) algorithms.
one is based on video signal and employs a combined structure
of a convolutional neural network (cnn) and an rnn. the other
uses accelerometer data and only requires an rnn. fixed-point
optimization that quantizes most of the weights into two bits is
conducted to optimize the amount of memory size for weight
storage and reduce the power consumption in hardware and
software based implementations.
