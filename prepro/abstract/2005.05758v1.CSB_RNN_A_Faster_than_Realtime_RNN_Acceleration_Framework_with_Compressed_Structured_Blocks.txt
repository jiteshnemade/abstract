recurrent neural networks (rnns) have been widely adopted in
temporal sequence analysis, where realtime performance is often
in demand. however, rnns suffer from heavy computational workload as the model often comes with large weight matrices. pruning
(a model compression method) schemes have been proposed for
rnns to eliminate the redundant (close-to-zero) weight values. on
one hand, the non-structured pruning methods achieve a high pruning rate but introducing computation irregularity (random sparsity), which is unfriendly to parallel hardware. on the other hand,
hardware-oriented structured pruning suffers from low pruning
rate due to restricted constraints on allowable pruning structure.
this paper presents csb-rnn, an optimized full-stack rnn
framework with a novel compressed structured block (csb) pruning technique. the csb pruned rnn model comes with both fine
pruning granularity that facilitates a high pruning rate and regular
structure that benefits the hardware parallelism. to address the
challenges in parallelizing the csb pruned model inference with
fine-grained structural sparsity, we propose a novel hardware architecture with a dedicated compiler. gaining from the architecturecompilation co-design, the hardware not only supports various
rnn cell types, but is also able to address the challenging workload
imbalance issue and therefore significantly improves the hardware
efficiency (utilization). compared to the vanilla design without optimizations, the hardware utilization has been enhanced by over
2×. with experiments on 10 rnn models from multiple application domains, csb pruning demonstrates 3.5×-25× lossless pruning
rate, which is 1.6× to 3.9× over existing designs. with several other
innovations applied, the csb-rnn inference can achieve fasterthan-realtime latency of 0.79µs-6.58µs in an fpga implementation,
which contributes to 1.12×-12.57× lower latency and 3.53×-58.89×
improvement on power-efficiency over the state-of-the-art.
