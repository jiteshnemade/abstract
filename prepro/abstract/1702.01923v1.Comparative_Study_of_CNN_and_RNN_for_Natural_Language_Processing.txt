deep neural networks (dnns) have revolutionized the field of natural language
processing (nlp). convolutional neural
network (cnn) and recurrent neural
network (rnn), the two main types of
dnn architectures, are widely explored to
handle various nlp tasks. cnn is supposed to be good at extracting positioninvariant features and rnn at modeling
units in sequence. the state-of-the-art on
many nlp tasks often switches due to the
battle of cnns and rnns. this work is
the first systematic comparison of cnn
and rnn on a wide range of representative nlp tasks, aiming to give basic guidance for dnn selection.
