long short-term memory (lstm) and recurrent neural network (rnn) has achieved great successes
on time-series prediction. in this paper, a methodology of using lstm-based deep-rnn for twophase flow regime prediction is proposed, motivated by previous research on constructing deep rnn.
the method is featured with fast response and accuracy. the built rnn networks are trained and
tested with time-series void fraction data collected using impedance void meter. the result shows
that the prediction accuracy depends on the depth of network and the number of layer cells. however,
deeper and larger network consumes more time in predicting.
