convolutional neural networks (cnns) attained a
good performance in hyperspectral sensing image (hsi) classification, but cnns consider spectra as orderless vectors. therefore,
considering the spectra as sequences, recurrent neural networks
(rnns) have been applied in hsi classification, for rnns is
skilled at dealing with sequential data. however, for a longsequence task, rnns is difficult for training and not as effective as
we expected. besides, spatial contextual features are not considered in rnns. in this study, we propose a shorten spatial-spectral
rnn with parallel-gru (st-ss-pgru1 ) for hsi classification. a
shorten rnn is more efficient and easier for training than bandby-band rnn. by combining converlusion layer, the st-sspgru
model considers not only spectral but also spatial feature, which
results in a better performance. an architecture named parallelgru is also proposed and applied in st-ss-pgru. with this
architecture, the model gets a better performance and is more
robust.
