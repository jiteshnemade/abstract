introduction  data driven approaches to predicting machine condition has seen rapid advancements due to low cost  sensor technology and reduced computational cost. in machining based operations  a critical asset to  obtaining superior part quality are the cutting tool inserts. these inserts continuously wear out and are  replaced in a production based environment. the continuous estimation of the tool wear classifications  caused by abrasion  erosion or tool breakage is necessary to improve the reliability of the metal cutting  manufacturing processes. tool breakage can be detected by robust power monitoring techniques  leading  to emergency shut off of the machine. however  tool wear due to abrasion and erosion are hard to  estimate in continuous production environments. at present  production environments resort to offline  detection through the use of in machine laser probes which measure wear amounts on the cutting tool  surface or a scheduled replacement of cutting tools based on regular machining time intervals. nonoptimized changeover of cutting tool inserts can lead to lost production efficiency and reduced part  quality. detection and prediction of tool wear amounts in real time is necessary to improve discrete  manufacturing systems operations.  research in diagnosing and prediction of tool wear has been carried out for decades. this problem is  particularly difficult due to modeling difficulties involved in a non linear time variant process. to cope  with this problem  prediction techniques have been applied to estimate future tool wear amounts but often  resort to intrusive sensing techniques which are limited in practical industrial implementation. sensor  signals are dependent on a number of factors including machine state  machining conditions and position  of the sensor. adding to the complexity is the apparent variability in the cutting tool  inconsistencies in          the material properties of the workpiece and the larger number of machining conditions that must be  accounted for.  several methods have been proposed in the literature for tool wear estimation and prognosis through both  linear and non linear prediction. the most widely used non linear prediction for tool wear methods  involve neural networks  nn . various works have shown the power of nn in terms of predicting tool  wear amounts which can meet accuracy requirements. they do however require large data to collect over  periods of time under various machining conditions. recurrent neural networks  rnn  were proposed as  an improvement over regular feed forward neural networks to account for cyclic connections over time.  each successive time step in the machining states are stored in the internal state of the network to provide  a temporal memory. however  conventional rnn did suffer from gradient vanishing or exploding issues   hochreiter  et al.        when it is trained with gradient based learning and back propagation through  time  bptt  methods. new variations in rnn  the gated recurrent neural networks  including long shortterm memory  lstm  and gated recurrent units  gru   have been developed to address this problem.  long short term memory  lstm  is a rnn architecture that is excellent at remembering both shortterm and long term dependencies. originally designed by hochreiter  et al.         this method was  developed to address the issue of the vanishing and or exploding gradient problem when number of layers  in the neural network is increased. these rnns in the form of lstms have been very successfully used  in speech recognition  language modeling  network traffic regulation  visual recognition and many others.  the objective of this study is to improve tool wear estimation and rul prediction by utilizing an lstm  based rnn framework  which makes more effective use of model parameters to train system observation  and transition models of tool wear processes. we utilize minimally intrusive vibration sensors to collect  the signal online and help train the rnn model. we train and compare our lstm models with other  forms of rnn. the solution approach can be extended to assess other critical assets of a manufacturing  machine. the organization of this work is as follows  first  we provide a brief overview of related work in  estimating tool wear using neural networks. the gated rnn architecture and equations are laid out as the  basis of our work. we detail our experimental setup and selected cutting conditions for tool wear  diagnosis and prognosis. we finally report on the ability of the method to provide real time estimation   one step and two step look ahead predictions of tool wear state  as well as rul prediction.   . related work  neural networks  nn  were widely used for modeling and predicting tool wear because they can learn  complex non linear patterns without the need for an underlying data relationship. they have strong selflearning and self adaptive capabilities. most previous work do not consider the sequential nature of the  sensor data or are reliant on a combination of intrusive sensors that limits its practical use. feature  extraction and selection are most commonly performed  which therefore require some form of human  labor involved in deciphering the sensor signals.  wang  et al. s        work proposed the fully forward connected neural network  ffcnn   and the  optimized ffcnn by pruning some weights among the network. it was trained by the extended kalman  filter  ekf   rather than the back propagation  bp . the result shows that it has better performance than  multilayer perceptron  mlp  trained with bp.  zel  et al.        applied the feed forward neural  network  ffnn  to estimate the surface roughness  and tool flank wear using a variety of cutting  conditions. bayesian regularization with levenberg marquardt method is used in training to obtain good  generalization capability and help in determining the number of neurons in the hidden layers. however   these two methods still did not consider time dependencies of the inputs and outputs to model  and cannot  make prediction of the future tool wear.  kamarthi  et al.        and luetzig  et al.        proposed a method composing radial basis function  networks  rbf  networks and a rnn. rbfn approach fuses and maps the sensor signal to the tool wear   which leads to the estimation of tool wear amounts. the method considers the time dependencies of the  inputs  the sensor signal  and the past estimated tool wear  which is better than the ffnn and mlp          methods. however  the number of time steps of temporal dependencies is predefined in the model  rather  than determined by any input value. moreover  the developed method is limited to estimating the tool  wear amount online  but cannot predict the future tool wear and hence the rul of the cutting tool.  overcoming the limitation of simple rnn  the gated recurrent neural networks were proposed in tool  wear monitoring and prediction. the simple rnn can only realize one step ahead and two step ahead  prediction  but its horizon on prediction is limited  meaning that it is limited in its ability to be extended to  rul prediction. the conventional rnns cannot capture long term dependencies  resulting in the nn not  able to capture previous long term history into current estimation. this is due to the well described  problem of the vanishing or exploding gradient as the number of time steps in the rnn increases.  therefore  gated recurrent neural networks  including lstm and gru  were developed to avoid this  problem.  the motivation for this work is that a model free approach which does not need an underlying analytical  model and it would be a better approach to capture long term dependences  prediction in an arbitrary  horizon and remaining useful life prediction for a non linear time variant process. the advantages of our  approach over existing ann and rnn approaches are     lstm based rnns capture time dependencies and make prediction over conventional nns that are  based on feed forward neural networks.    the proposed approach does not have the limitation of limited prediction horizon period  which is the  major drawback of time delayed neural networks.    time delayed based rnns  although can achieve time dependencies  the method cannot realize  arbitrary time step ahead and rul prediction.    our approach of including a model system transition and system observation function separately  can naturally realize diagnosis and prognosis within the lstm based rnn architecture.   . construction of an rnn state space model for tool wear monitoring  the proposed approach is a model free method based on recurrent neural networks by formulating a  temporal dependent relationship between in process indirect measurement and in process real machine  state  and the relationships between the real machine states themselves in the temporal domain. due to its  model free nature  rnn can model the non linear relationship between their inputs and outputs.  therefore  the assumption pertaining to the markov model and linearity can be avoided. long term  dependencies cannot be modeled by conventional rnn approaches. here we adapt the long short term  memory  lstm  and grated recurrent units  gru  to model long term dependencies for multi step  prognosis of tool wear processes. we build a system observation function and a system transition function  with simple rnn  lstm and gru. we split experimental data collected to a training set  validation and  a test set. we train the system observation function and the system transition function separately to help  tune its individual parameters and to implement independent training protocols. more importantly  the  independent training also allows us these functions to go through varying training iterations. a  comparison will be made between rnn  lstm and gru for the system observation and system  transition function respectively  and then the best rnn model will be selected for one of these functions.  with the trained models  an online machine state estimation is realized by the indirect sensor  measurement. building on the idea of generative models  graves         an arbitrary time step ahead  prediction can be updated in real time  as well as to predict remaining useful life  rul .   . . system transition function  for dynamic mechanical systems  the system state may have temporal dependencies. more specifically   the current system state is affected by its past system states. therefore  the system transition function can  be generically written as follows           yt     p yt   yt      where yt    y   y      yt   here  yt is the direct measurement of the system state. when the system transition function is modeled as  an rnn  the function can be rewritten as   yt     p yt   yt             where  is the hidden nodes for the system transition function  with superscript letter  trans   denoting it. the current hidden node  is a function of the past hidden node  and current input  yt. so via the hidden node  current hidden node bear all the current and past information to the inputs.    yt          f   so that          y   y      yt         which the function  takes the whole pass sequence  y   y      yt   so that the system state at time  t   can be modeled given all the past system state information. note that in our implementation  the  variable here is a continuous value and its distribution is assumed as unimodal  although it is possible to  extend to the arbitrary value with arbitrary distribution.   . . system observation function  the direct measurement of the real system state is often not practically feasible to be collected in  production environments  such as actual tool wear amounts on cutting tool inserts. the system state can  be inferred from indirect measurements  such as one or more sensor signals. also  in most cases  there is  not a good function that can build a relationship between the direct measurement of the system state and  its associated indirect measurement. also  any developed relationship must consider temporal effects.  specifically  with availability of any past direct measurements of the system state  the determination of  current system state should refer to all past indirect measurements. therefore  the system observation  function can be written as   yt  p yt xt      where xt    x   x      xt   here  xt is the indirect measurement at time step t  and yt is the direct measurement of the system state.  with rnn  the system observation function can be rewritten as   yt  p yt xt         where  is the hidden nodes for the observation function with superscript letter  obs  denoting it.  similar to    the hidden nodes for the system transition function     f     xt      so that      x   x      xt       which the function  takes the whole pass sequence  x   x      xt .   . . long short term memory  lstm  cell  lstm cell is an advanced version of the rnn cell  which are excellent at remembering values for either  long or short time periods. it consists of repeating memory cell units  each of which consists of interacting  elements   the cell state  and three gates that protect the cell state   input gate  a forget gate and an output  gate  figure   . the gates  via the activation function  control the flow of information to update the cell  state. the input gate controls the new input flow into the memory  and the output gate controls the extent          of the flow from memory into the output nodes. the forget gates  which implements in the self loops   control the gradient flow from previous cells from the long temporal past  thereby adaptively forgetting or  including the distant memory. additionally  with gated self loops controlled by the weights  the time  scale of integration can also be controlled by the forget gates  goodfellow  et al.      . at each time step  t  the hidden state  ht is updated by xt  the current data at the time step  the hidden state at previous time ht   input gate i  forget gate f  output gate o and the internal memory cell c. u and w are the weight matrices.  input gates   i    i xtui   ht  wi   forget gates   f    f xtuf   ht  wf   output gates   o    o xtuo   ht  wo   g   tanh xtug   ht  wg   where g is candidate hidden state which is used to calculate the real hidden state.  ct   ct   f   g i  ht   tanh ct   o  as seen from the above equations  all the gates can be determined by the input x t and hidden nodes ht     with weights that can be tuned during the training process.  finally  the output calculation  the output yt is written as  yt    y htwy by   where    is activation function  xt is the input at time step t  and yt is the output at time step t. and b is bias.    figure   lstm cell block diagram. the forget gate acts like  throttle  controlling the amplitude of the  input  output  and self loop  respectively.   . . gated recurrent units  gru  cell  gru cell is a special kind of gating mechanism for the lstm cell of an rnn. it has simpler structure  and thus fewer parameters than the lstm cell. as a simplified version of lstm cell  the gru cell was  proposed by  chung  et al.         which has less gates and thus less weights to be tuned. there are only  two kinds of gates for gru  reset gate  r  and update gate  z. the reset gate determines how to combine          new input with that of the previous memory in its cells. on the other hand  the update gate decides the  portion of its previous memory does it retain or throw out. the equations for the gru cell are similar to  the lstm   z    z xtuz   ht  wz   r    r xtur   ht  wr   h   tanh xtuh   ht  wh   ht      z  h   z ht    since there are only   gates  the important difference between a gru versus an lstm is that gru does  not possess an internal memory  ct . the reset gate is directly applied to the previous hidden state  ht   .  thus  it can train faster since there are only few parameters in the u and w matrices and hence maybe  useful when not much training data is available.   . . rnn training process with long term dependencies  the early stopping technique is used for the training process. the number of iterations is the count of  looping through the whole training set  and the mean square error  mse  of the training set and  validation set is estimated for each loop. the mse of the validation data set is used as a reference to meet  certain criterion about the mse of the system state estimation. for each time step  the weights in the rnn  model is updated by the back propagation through time  bptt   which is a gradient based technique to  train the rnn. specifically  the adaptive moment estimation  adam   having the best performance is  used for the bptt   kingma  et al.      . since the bptt multiplies gradient over a large number of time  steps  the resulted gradient either get vanished or explode over multiple layers. the recurrent net tends to  induce lstm cell and gru cell to avoid the gradient vanishing occurrence in simple rnn. on the other  hand  the exploded gradient can lead to the training process to be unstable  leading to the algorithm to find  a non optimal solution. this is solved by clipping the gradient to a determined maximum value. as stated  previously  the rnn for system transition and system observation are trained independently. the rnn  cells  elman rnn cell   lstm cell  and gru cell will be tested and compared on the performance index  of their online estimation. the mean square error  mse  will be applied as a criterion for these three  different cells. moreover  as model free methods  there is no assumption that there is any certain forms of  relationship between the variables at time domain  regardless whether they are linear or nonlinear.   . . diagnosis and prognosis with rnn  after the three kinds of rnn model of system transition and system observation is trained  they can be  further applied for diagnosis and prognosis of the system state  by inputting the indirect measurement in  real time. our proposed method is to realize online diagnosis  by taking advantage of the indirect  measurement from past and current states  p yt    xt   where xt   x      xt . for prognosis  following the  method of the generative recurrent neural networks  graves         the produced values from output  nodes and the hidden nodes of the rnn of the system transition is inputted into the input node and  hidden node of the model itself. this process is repeated  and the number of the repetitions is equal to the  predicted number of time step horizons. lastly  for remaining useful life  rul  prediction  the criterion  of the degradation is set to certain value  for example  .  mm for the tool wear. by apply the generative  model of rnn for system transition  until the predicted degradation variable reaches the criterion  the  number of time step it passes through can be the predicted rul  which in our case  will be the number of  time steps it will take to reach the tool wear criteria.   . experimental evaluation   . . setup  in order to evaluate the performance of the lstm based rnn method  experiments were conducted to  obtain actual tool insert wear measurements using the haas vf  cnc mill machine under dry milling  machining conditions. a two flute indexable milling tool with diameter   .  mm  sandvik coromill       ra       o     l  installed with one uncoated insert  sandvik coromill     insert     r       mpm  was used in the cutting process. the workpiece material utilized is steel       cold rolled                 hrc   . each single cutting pass was   .  mm long  with the spindle speed at     rpm  leading to a  surface speed of   .  m min and chip load at cutting to be  .  mm. the radial depth of cut is  .  mm and  axial depth at  .  mm. feed rate is    mm min. a   axis vibration sensor  kistler accelerometers      a    was installed on the fixture attached to the workpiece  figure   . sensor data was sampled at      khz and its rms signal formed the online indirect measurement. no force dynamometers were used  in this study to emulate minimally intrusive sensing. after every single pass of cut along the length of the  workpiece  offline direct measurements were taken to measure actual tool wear. the machining process  was repeated for two experimental runs. the rms of the vibrations signals for the two repeated runs are  shown in figure  . the vibration signal curves do not monotonically increase with the tool wear. the  signal curves show that it is critical to account for the time dependency for any diagnosis and prognosis of  cutting tool wear.    figure   schematic diagram of experimental setup with micrographs of the cutting tool surface at  various cut path numbers.    figure   vibration index for two replications of cutting the same materia under similar machining  conditions. the only difference is the each replication was carried out by a brand new cutting tool insert  but of the same specifications.   . . model training          early stopping is applied to loop through the training set for a number of iterations for the three kinds of  rnn model for the system transition and observation functions  respectively. the mean square error   mse  of the validation set is evaluated for each iteration. the whole dataset is divided into three parts   the first one is the training set    pairwise sequences   the second one is the validation set    pairwise  sequences   and the last one is the test set    pairwise sequences . for each time step  the weights in the  rnn model  u and w  are updated by the backward propagation  bptt . for each sequence  the values  of hidden nodes is reset to zero. the rnn for system transition and system observation are also trained  independently.  during the training process  the reduction rate of the average mse decreases as the training proceeds. the  iteration number is set as     given the computational capacity and average mse is good enough for  estimation. comparing the mse values for the system transition function  the results show that the  average mse of the lstm is lower than the other two   elman rnn and gru. the standard deviation   std.  also shows that the stability of the lstm to have relative good performance for both system  transition and observation  see table   .  table   compare mse of validation set for rnn  lstm  and gru for system transition and  observation  system transition    system observation    rnn cell type    avg. of mse   mm      std. of mse   mm

      .            .           all the rnns have one hidden layer with   hidden nodes. the mse of validation set of trained lstm for  system transition function is  .        mm   and the mse of validation set of applied trained lstm of  the system observation function is  .        mm . since there are more parameters in the lstm cell  than the other two  elman rnn and gru  it shows its flexibility to fit the data and exhibit more adaptive  properties to construct the complexity of the time dependencies  although more computational resources  maybe needed for determining the parameters in the model.   . results   . . online diagnosis  by applying the lstm for system observation  given the indirect measurement of the current and past  time step  the rms of the vibration signal  the model is able to estimate the tool wear at current time step.                                                                                                        figure   online tool wear diagnosis with indirect measurement. the dots indicate the actual measured  tool wear  the solid lines are the estimated tool wear. a  replication    b  replication    for replication    figure  a   the estimated tool wear closely fit the real tool wear  and thus the curve  shape of the estimation appear more like a bending line  rather than a smooth curve  thanks to the online  estimation of the tool wear which is adjusted based on the indirect measurement. for the replication     figure  b   there is an abrupt tool wear change between the  rd to the  th cut. the estimated tool wear  adjusts for approaching the real tool wear  with certain time lag. this illustrates that the method is robust  in certain extent on tolerating abrupt change.  online one step and two step ahead prediction  for one step ahead prediction  the estimated tool wear at current time step is input into the input node of  the lstm for the system transition function. it assumes that the tool wear at time step   is equal to   . mm  yt     .  mm . the predicted tool wear at next time step t   is the value from the output node of  the rnn for the system transition  given the hidden node and estimated tool wear at current time step t.  this means that the tool wear at next time step is predicted given the current and past tool wear estimation  as given by the system observation function  figure   . similar to online one step ahead prediction  the  tool wear at two time step ahead is predicted given the next  current and past tool wear estimates by the  system transition function and the system observation function and  figure   . the predicted tool wear for  one step and two step ahead appear smoother than online estimated ones  and do not closely fit the tool  wear. they provide the prediction of the tool wear and show the trend of the tool wear. when the time  step proceeds to the predicted cutting step  the estimation is updated according to the online indirect  measurement.          figure   online tool wear one step ahead prediction with indirect measurement. the solid circles  indicate the actual tool wear  the solid lines are the predicted tool wear.  the proposed method is robust to certain abrupt change in the system state  the tool wear. arbitrary  number of time step ahead prediction can be realized by the proposed method. similar to online two step  ahead prediction  the tool wear at three or multiple time step ahead can be predicted given the two step  ahead or multiple time minus one step ahead  current and past tool wear estimation by the system  transition function and system observation function respectively.    figure   online tool wear two step ahead prediction with indirect measurement. the circles indicate  the actual tool wear amount  the solid lines are the predicted tool wear.   . . remaining useful life  rul  prediction  at each time step  by looping the rnn for system transition  which means if we input the values of the  hidden and output nodes of rnn for system transition of the last time step into the hidden nodes and  input nodes of the next time step  and repeat the process  until the value of the output nodes reaches the  criterion for the tool wear set to be at  .  mm. both of the rul predictions start at    cuts  figure   . for  replication   and    the predicted rul is updated according to the online indirect measurement  so that  the predicted rul can be adjusted to approach the real rul.    figure   online rul prediction. the dashed lines indicate the actual rul  the solid lines are the  predicted rul.   . discussion           lstm and gru  as gated rnn  can capture the long term time dependencies as a model for the system  transition and observation functions  compared to the simple rnn and elman rnn. by taking advantage  of the trained rnn system observation model  the tool wear can be estimated from currently observed  indirect measurement and past indirect measurements. also  for tool wear prediction  one time step ahead  tool wear prediction can be realized by input into rnn system transition function  the estimated current  and past tool wear by the rnn system observation function. for two step ahead tool wear prediction  the  one step ahead tool wear prediction by the rnn system transition function and all the estimated tool wear  by the rnn system observation function act as inputs into the rnn system transition model  thus   resulting in the two step ahead tool wear prediction. similarly  the multiple time step ahead prediction can  also be estimated. this is attributed to the design of the generative rnn  in which our proposed model  can predict arbitrary number of time step ahead tool wear degradation in the future.  two replications of the tool were tested to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed model approach. it is to  be noted that despite the same cutting conditions  the tool wear diagnosis and prognosis is quite different  for the two replications. this is typical of all cutting tools since they can wear down at varying rates and  patterns. we are able to predict the tool wear amounts on the fly  which confirms that the necessary  diagnosis and prognosis methods can be adapted online. furthermore  the rul prediction can also be  predicted until the tool wear reaches the set criterion.  in this study  the indirect measurement is the signal obtained from the vibration generated during the  cutting process. as a black box method  the neural network model does not explicitly show the formula  of the system observation and system transition function as seen in the particle learning method proposed  by zhang  et al         and any other analytic models typically used in cutting tool wear estimation. the  lstm based rnn approach can increase the computation cost  and the challenge here is to decide the  complexity of the network  number of layers and number of hidden nodes  given the reward is the  flexibility of the fitting any form of relationship. additionally  the system transition function also needs to  be trained beforehand before applying the prognosis process. this method can have desirable diagnosis  and prognosis result especially if the tool wear gradually occurs but also can tolerate certain abrupt tool  wear change. however  for different material and different machining conditions  new data should be  collected to train a new model.  the lstm based rnn can make prediction more superior than the feed forward neural network. second   the approach is also better than the time delay neural network  which can only predict limited time step  ahead of machine states. third  for the rnn with only time delayed form  it cannot realize the arbitrary  number of time step ahead prediction  not to mention not being able to predict rul. fourth  malhotra  et  al.        used the rul as target variable and sensor signal to be modeled with the rnn. however  the  rul does not reflect any physical characterization  so that there is no direct physical connection between  the sensor signal and rul. also  the approach of using rul as target variable cannot realize machine  state diagnosis and prognosis. compared to these methods  the approach of modeling the system  transition function and system observation function with the rnn renders the online estimation  considering the time dependencies become natural. taking the schema of the generative rnn  arbitrary  time step ahead prediction get realized by combining the system transition function and system  observation function modeled by rnns. further  by applying advanced form rnn cell  the lstm  gru   the long term time dependencies can be captured.  the neural network model is a more flexible method than the analytic model  which do not need physical  formula within the model. the proposed approach by modeling the system transition and system  observation with long term time dependency helps realize the online estimation of the system state and  predicts the arbitrary future horizon of the system state  by the given current and past indirect  measurements. the application of this method can be extended into any critical components of the  physical machine  such as bearings  gears  engine  ball screws  grinding wheels  nano machining           processes and bioreactors  in which only indirect measurements are accessible in real time and there is a  need to estimate and predict the system state.  there are several possible ways to improve the accuracy of the prediction. first one is to loop through  more number of iterations of the training set to train the model  second one is to use more hidden nodes or  more layers of hidden nodes and even combining the dropout technique  srivastava  et al.        within  the neural network model  third one is to collect more data to train the model. with more data to train the  model  and more available data for the validation  the model can get more robust and have more stable  performance in diagnosis and prognosis. moreover  one can also use the n fold or leave one out cross  validation method to get stable evaluation of the mse of both the rnn for system transition and rnn for  system observation. incorporating more time domain and frequency domain feature of the signal into the  inputs of the model  so that feature engineering work should be implemented.   . conclusion  the paper proposes a framework for the machine state diagnosis and prognosis using rnn models for  system transition and observation function via indirect measurements. the lstm and gru  which can  capture the long term dependencies is used to model those two functions. the validation set was used to  evaluate the estimation accuracy by the mse. two replications of sequence of the indirect measurement   as test set  is used by the proposed model  to demonstrate the online estimation  one and two time step  prediction  and rul prediction. the results were compared with the real tool wear and showed good fit.  rul prediction was also compared with the real rul. the validation set shows acceptable mse for both  system observation and transition functions. after comparison with the real values  the results show good  performance and strong possibility for practical usage. first  as model free methods  the neural network  requires no analytic formula in modeling. second  the lstm cell modeled system transition and system  observation functions  which capture the long term temporal dependencies  has better performance than  the simple rnn to model them. the arbitrary horizon of prediction can be realized by taking advantage  of the modeled system transition function and the generative model  and thus the rul prediction. it is  very possible to extend the proposed methods for diagnosis and prognosis of system state by indirect  measurement for other physical entities  such as gears  bearings  ball screw  motors  etc.
