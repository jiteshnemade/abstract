introduction  one of the challenges in machine learning is to provide  a mathematical theory for analyzing learning algorithms.  recently  there has been a surge of interest in the use of  neural networks  leading to the emergence of the field of  deep learning. one of the most widespread models used in  deep learning are recurrent neural networks  rnns . rnns  can seen as non linear dynamical systems equipped with an  internal state  input and output. learning such an rnn from  data is equivalent to estimating the parameters of the rnn   viewed as a dynamical system. that is  learning algorithms  for rnns correspond to system identification algorithms   and developing a mathematical theory for learning rnns  is equivalent to developing system identification for rnns.  there is a rich literature on system identification  in particular on system identification for linear systems     . note that  linear dynamical systems are a particular class of rnns.  one of the principal building blocks of system identification theory for linear systems is realization theory.  realization theory can be viewed as an attempt to solve  an idealized system identification problem  where there is  infinite data  not modelling error  etc. in general  the aim of  realization theory is to understand the relationship between  an observed behavior and dynamical systems producing this  observed behavior. for the particular case of rnns  the main  questions of realization theory can be stated as follows      which class of observed behaviors  input output maps   can be represented by an rnn    centre de recherche en informatique  signal et automatique de lille   cristal   cnrs  ecole centrale  universit de lille  avenue carl gauss         villeneuve d ascq  france  e mail

european regional development fund  erdf   french state and the french region of  hauts de france. this work was partially funded by agence nationale pour  la recherche project rocc sys under the grant agreement anr    c             how can we characterize minimal rnns  rnns of  the least complexity  representing a certain observed  behavior   what is the appropriate definition of minimality  smallest number of neurons  etc.  for rnns   are minimal rnns are related by some transformation        is there a constructive procedure for constructing a  rnn representation from input output behavior which  can be proven to be mathematically correct    for linear systems  realization theory            has been  useful for system identification  for example it helped to  address identifiability  canonical forms and gave rise to  subspace identification algorithms. we expect that realization  theory of rnns will lead to similarly useful results for the  latter dynamical systems.  in order to develop realization theory of rnns  we embed  rnns into the class of rational systems  and then we use  realization theory of rational polynomial systems in order to  derive new results on realization theory of rnns. then the  proposed embedding could also be useful beyond realization  theory  as it could open up the possibility of studying for  example stability of rnns by using existing results on  stability of rational polynomial systems. for example  for a  large class of activation functions  rnns can be embedded  into a homogeneous polynomial systems and the states of the  latter systems are continuous functions of the states of the  original rnns. this then opens up the possibility of studying  stability of rnns by using stability theory of homogeneous  systems           .  in this paper  we consider rnns in continuous time  in  order to avoid some technical difficulties encountered in  the discrete time case. note that discrete time rnns can be  viewed as discretizations of continuous time rnns  i.e. they  arise by discretizing the differential equations describing the  state evolution of continuous time rnns  which indicates  that the results of this paper could be relevant for the discretetime case.  in this paper we assume that the high order derivatives of  the activation function satisfy a polynomial equation. several  widely used activation functions have this property.            we show that an input output map can be realized by a  rnn  only if it can be realized by a rational system  i.e.  a non linear system defined by vector fields and readout  maps which are fractions of polynomials. we present an  explicit construction of such a rational system.  we present a necessary condition for existence of a  realization by rnns  using results from realization  theory of rational systems. this necessary condition is     a generalization of the well known rank condition for  hankel matrices of linear systems.    we formulate sufficient conditions for observability reachability minimality of rnns  using existing realization theory for rational systems                      .  note that rnns could be viewed as analytic systems and  one could try to apply realization theory of analytic systems                 . however  realization theory for analytic  systems is not computationally effective  i.e.  there are no  algorithms for checking minimality  deciding equivalence of  two systems  transforming a system to a minimal one  etc.  this is inherent to the system class  analytical functions  do not have a finite representation. this is in contrast to  rational and polynomial systems  where tools from computer  algebra could be used     . in addition  since rational and  polynomial systems have much more algebraic structures  than analytic systems  we expect them to yield richer results  for realization theory of rnns than analytical systems. in  fact  the conditions for observability reachability minimality  of rnns which are derived in this paper are less restrictive  than those which can be obtained by viewing rnns as  analytic systems                .  to the best of our knowledge  the results of the paper  are new. rnns have been widely used in the machine  learning literature  both in discrete time and continuoustime            . observability of rnns was studied in       controllability in      and minimality in    . this paper was  inspired by                 but in contrast to                  we do not use any assumption on the structure of the weight  matrices  except for observability issues. this means that the  results of this paper can be applied even when the results of                 are not applicable.  in section ii we present the basic notation and terminology  and we present the formal definition of rnns   rational systems and their input output maps. in section iii  we present the construction of the rational system which  realizes the same input output map as an rnn. in section  iv  we use the results of section iii to derive necessary  conditions for existence of a realization by rnn. finally  in  section v we use the results of section iii to derive sufficient  conditions for minimality of rnns. an extended version of  this paper containing detailed proofs can be found in the  technical report    .  ii. basic    definitions    in this section  we give fix some notation and we recall  some algebraic tools necessary for this paper. then we recall  the definition of rnns and of rational systems.  a. preliminaries  we use the standard terminology and notation from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry see                .  in particular  by r x    . . .   xn   we denote the algebra of real  polynomials in n variables and by r x    . . .   xn   we denote  the quotient field of r x    . . .   xn  . we refer to the element  of r x    . . .   xn   as rational functions in n variables. if s  is an integral domain over r then the transcendence degree    trdegs of s over r is defined as the transcendence degree  over r of the field f of fractions of s and it equals the  greatest number of algebraically independent elements of f  over r.  b. recurrent neural networks.  below we define formally what we mean by recurrent  neural networks in continuous time. we will follow the  notation of               .  definition    a recurrent neural network  abbreviated by  rnn  with input space u   rm and output space rp   is a  dynamical system             ax t    bu t     x  t                  x      x   y t    cx t            where        r   r is a continuous globally lipschitz scalar  function. it is called the activation function  of the  rnn .  n n    a   r    b   rn m and c   rp n are matrices   called weight matrices         n  n    the map     r   r is defined by             x   . . .   x  t       x    . . .     x   t              n    n    n    u t  is an input  x t    r is the state and y t  is the  output at time t  and x    rn is the initial state.  we denote such a system by      a  b  c  u     x   .  if we take   the identity map in definition    it is the  same as a linear system in control theory. it follows that  rnns provide a class of semi linear systems  for which one  might expect that a theory closer to that of linear system  than in case of general non linear smooth systems.  next we define formally what we mean by a solution and  an input output map of a system      a  b  c  u     x   . to  this end  in the sequel  we denote by p c          x  the  set of piecewise continuous functions from         to x   where x   rk   k    .  definition    a triple  x  u  y  is a solution of an rnn       a  b  c  u     x    if u   p c          u   x             rn   y            rp   x is absolutely continuous  and     holds.  remark    let      a  b  c  u     x    be an rnn. as  the activation function   is globally lipschitz  we know  that  for every piecewise continuous input u            u   there exists a unique absolutely continuous functions x             rn and a function y            rp such that   x  u  y  is a solution of  .  in this paper  we focus on solutions  x  u  y  of an rnn  such that u is piecewise constant.  notation    piecewise constant inputs   we denote by  upc the set of all piecewise constant functions of the form  u            u.  definition    let p   upc   p c          rp   be an  input output map  and let      a  b  c  u     x    be an  rnn.   is said to be a realization of the input output map p  if for every u   upc   the unique solution  x  u  y   x      x   of   is such that p u    y.        c. rational and polynomial systems.  informally  rational respectively polynomial systems are  control systems in continuous time  whose differential equations and readout maps are rational functions  i.e. they are  fractions of polynomials  respectively polynomial functions.  definition    polynomial and rational systems   a rational system with input space u   rm   state space rn and  output space rp is a dynamical system as     p     t      i      . . .   n                i  t    qi u t   i u t     t         r   hk      t    yk  t    hk      t      k      . . .   p    iii. e mbedding    of a class of recurrent neural    network realizations into rational  realizations .    in this section we show that an rnn realization of a given  input output map imply the existence of a rational system  which is a realization of the same map. moreover  we present  the construction of such a rational realization.  in order to state the announced result  we have to restrict  the class of activation function   by introducing the following assumption.  assumption    a    the function     r   r is analytic   and there exist an integer n     and n analytic functions       . . .    n   r   r such that  where     t    u t  is the input    t         t   . . .    n  t   is the state     v        . . .    n     u        . . .    n    and y t     y   t   . . .   yk  t  t is the output at time t.            moreover      rn is the initial state    i vi       . . .    n     ui       . . .    n     if     i   n    hk     hk     k      . . .   p are non zero polynomials in n  where uk   vk are polynomials in n variables.  variables and for all     u  i      . . .   n  pi     qi   are  assumption  a

tuple sumption  a   can be replaced by the following hypothesis     pi     qi    i   ... n   u    hk     hk    pk     u      . we will which involves only derivatives of the activation function  .  say that r is polynomial  if hk        qi       for all  assumption    a    the function     r   r is analytic   k      . . .   p  i      . . .   n      u.  and there exist an integer n     and a no zero polynomial  informally  a rational system is a non linear control system q in n     variables  such that  for which the right hand sides of the differential equation  q          . . .      n               and output equations are rational functions  i.e. fractions of  two polynomials. note that the existence and uniqueness of   i   a state trajectory of a rational system requires some care  where   denotes the i th derivative of  .  lemma    equivalence of  a   and  a     a function    as in our definition we did not exclude the possibility that  satisfies  assumption  a   if and only if it satisfies assumpx t  passes through the zero set of a denominator qi   . in  tion   a  .  order to avoid technical difficulties  we define a solution of  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  a rational system as follows   now we show that some widely used activation functions  definition    a triplet     u  y  is a solution of a rational  satisfy  assumption  a  .  system r of the form      if the input u            u is  example     let consider an analytic rnn of a response  n  piecewise constant  the state              r is absolutely  map  for  which  the activation function   is

realization    theorem   allows us to formulate a necessary condition  for realizability of an input output map by an rnn  using  conditions of      theorem  .    for existence of a realization by a rational system. in order to present this condition   we need to introduce additional notation and terminology. in  particular  we have to define the class of input output maps  which could potentially be realized by an rnn.  the most basic requirement for an input output map to be  realizable by a control system is causality   definition    an input output map p   upc    p c          rp   is causal if  for all t     and for all  u  v   upc such that  s       t    u s    v s   it holds  that  s       t    p u  s    p v  s .  in other words  p is causal  if p u  t  depends only on the  values of u on the interval     t . if p is the input output map  of a control system  then causality must necessarily hold.  another basic requirement is analyticity  if p is the inputoutput map of a control system defined by a differential equation with analytic right hand side  then for any piecewiseconstant input  p u  should be analytic in a suitable defined  sense  i.e.  in the dwell time of the constant pieces of u.  definition    an input output map p   upc    p c          rp   is analytic if  for all k       . . .   p  and  for all      . . .    l   u  l      the function  p k     ...  l             l   r is analytic  where   ...  l   p k     ...  l  t    . . .   tl     pk  ut    ... t    tl    l      i if t    ti     ti    i      . . .   l     ...  l  u   t   ... tl  t      l if t   tl    t        ti      i  x  j      tj   i         . . .   l.            notation    we denote by a upc   the set of causal  analytic input output maps of the form p   upc    p c          r .  note that the set a upc   forms an algebra over the field of  real numbers with the usual point wise addition  multiplication and multiplication by scalar.  remark    it can be shown that the algebra a u    pc   is  isomorphic to the ring of functions a g  upc   r defined  in      definition  .    if we take the set of all piecewiseconstant input functions defined on a finite interval as the  set of admissible inputs g  upc . therefore  a u    pc   has the  same algebraic properties as a g  upc   r   in particular   by      theorem  .    a upc   is an integral domain. the  isomorphism is defined as follows. for every     a upc    e  upc   r  such that   v      let us define the function  e   g    u  t   for any piecewise constant function v       t      u  where u is any piecewise constant function defined on          such that the restriction of u to     t   equals v. then  e  the map           is an algebraic isomorphism from a upc    g  to a upc   r .  definition     let     a upc   and define the derivative  d    of   along     u as the function d      upc    p c          r   such that for all u   upc   for all t             d   d    u   t          u    t   s   ds    s       u             t   u               t  it is easy to see that d    is also causal and analytic   and hence d    belongs to a upc  . now we define the  observation algebra of an input output map.  definition     let p   upc   p c          rp   be an analytic and causal input output map. the observation algebra  of p  denoted by    aobs  p   is the smallest sub algebra of the  algebra a upc such that the following holds.    consider the components pk   upc   p c          r    k      . . .   p of p  i.e.   u   upc   p u      p   u   . . .   pp  u  t . for every k      . . .   p  pk    aobs  p .    for every g   aobs  p   d  g   aobs  p       u  i.e.   aobs  p  is closed under taking derivatives d        u.  we call the observation field  denoted by qobs  p   the field  of fractions of aobs  p .  remark    observation algebra   field have already been  introduced in      definition  .   or in      definition  .    for response maps. moreover we know that the field qobs  p   is well defined because  from remark   we know that the algebra a upc   is an integral domain. thus the transcendence  degree of aobs  p   denoted by trdegaobs  p   is well defined   see section ii for the definition of transcendence degree.  now if an input output map p   upc   p c          rp    is realized by an rnn      a  b  c  u     x     with    satisfying assumption  a    then the rational system r      given in definition    also realizes the input output map  p by theorem   and lemma  . thus the transcendence  degree of the observation algebra aobs  p  of p should be  necessary finite by      theorem  .   . we are now in the    position to state a necessary condition for existence of an  rnn realization  which summarizes the arguments above.  theorem    existence of an rnn  necessary condition    the input output map p   upc   p c          rp   has  a realization by an rnn whose activation function  satisfies assumption  a   only if p is causal  analytic and  trdeg aobs  p      .  the proof of theorem   is presented in    .  v. m inimality     reachability and observability of    rnn s  in this section  we first provide sufficient conditions for  minimality of a given rnn   by assuming minimality of  the rational system r    given in definition  . since the  latter rational system is often non minimal  we introduce  in the sequel another rational system  called the auxiliary  rational system of the rnn    denoted by raux      also  used for providing sufficient minimal conditions of  . then  we provide a hankel rank like condition for minimality of  the rnn  . finally we relate reachability and observability  properties of raux      well known for rational systems  to  similar properties for    namely span reachability introduced  later in this paper and a necessary condition of observability  provided in     theorem   .  a. sufficient conditions for minimality of rnns  as the first step  we define the notion of dimension  for rnns and rational systems. let   be an rnn as in  definition  . the dimension of   is the dimension of its  state space  i.e. the number of states   and it is denoted by  dim   . in this case  we have dim      n. consider a  rational system r of the form    . the dimension of r   denoted by dim r   is here defined as the number of statevariables  i.e. dim r    n.  remark    dimension of rational systems   in      definition     rational systems were defined as systems statespace of which is an irreducible algebraic variety and the  dimension of a rational system was defined as the transcendence degree of the ring of all polynomial functions  on this variety. in our case the state space of the system  is rn which is a trivial algebraic variety. our definition of  dimension coincides with that of      definition      as the  transcendence degree of the ring of polynomials on rn is n.  now we are able to define minimal rnn realization and  minimal rational realization.  definition     minimality   we say that a rational system  r is a minimal realization of an input output map p  if r is     a realization of p and there exists no rational system r such        that r is a realization of p and dim r     dim r . an  rnn   with activation function   is said to be a   minimal  realization of an input output function p  if   is a realization     of p and there exists no rnn   with activation function           such that   is a realization of p and dim       dim   .  by considering the rational system r     we provide sufficient condition for minimality of rnns as follows.  lemma    let      a  b  c     x    be an rnn  whose  activation function   satisfies  a   and assume that   is a     realization of the input output map p. if the rational system  r     given in definition    is a minimal realization of p   then   is a minimal rnn realization of p.  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  unfortunately  in most of the cases  r    will not be  minimal. intuitively  this has to do with the fact that the  states x   t   . . .   xn  t  of r    are integrals of the other  states  leading to lack of observability if n     and x    is  chosen so that cx       .  in order to remedy this problem  we introduce another  rational system  called the auxiliary rational system depending on the rnn   with less components in the state.  in order to define this rational system without excessive  notation  we will use the same convention as for defining  r     namely we identify  sum of fraction of multipn the  pi  with  the fraction obtained  variable polynomials  k   qi  by  bringing  all  summands  to  the  same  denominator  i.e.   pn  n  k   pi  r   r  k qi  .   n  k   qi  definition     let      a  b  c  u     x    be an rnn   whose activation function satisfies  a    assume that            . . .    n   satisfies    . define the auxiliary rational system raux     associated with the rnn    a     ai j  ni j     c    ck i  k   ... p i   ... n as follows    i      . . .   n  j      . . .   n      u    n  u    l    t    ui   j    t   x    i j    t        aj l      if u t       vi   j    t    v    l    t    l       j    t        j    t   . . .    n j    t  t        j           etj  ax    b      n  x  u    i    t      k      . . .   p  ck i  yk    t     v    i    t    i      remark    polynomial raux       if assumption  a   is  satisfied with polynomial equations  i.e. vi      i       . . .   n   like in examples from example    then raux      is a polynomial system.  note that the rational system raux      given in definition      does not realize the input output map p  x  of the  rnn      a  b  c  u     x    in general. roughly speaking  it realizes the input output map constructed with the  derivatives of p  x  along      . . .    k   u in the sense  of definition   . we now formalize it properly. let p    upc   p c          rp   be an input output map realized  by the rnn  . define the input output map p    upc    p c          rpk    where k    u   as follows    u   upc      p  u     d   p u   . . .   d k p u  t             with  for     u  d  p u     d  pk  u    k p   where  d  pk  u  is defined in definition   .  lemma    let      a  b  c  u     x    be an rnn and  let p   upc   p c          rp   be an input output map.  if the rnn   realizes p  then the rational system raux      realizes the input output map p  defined in    .  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .    lemma    let      a  b  c  u     x    be an rnn and  let p   upc   p c          rp   be an input output map  realized by  . if the rational system raux     is a minimal  realization of p   then the rnn   is   minimal realization of  p.  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  it is known from            that the properties of algebraic  rational and semi algebraic observability and algebraic reachability characterize minimality of rational systems  and these properties can be checked using methods of computational algebra     . in particular  we can derive sufficient  conditions for the minimality of the rnn   using these  reachability and observability concepts for rational systems.  in order to explore these sufficient conditions in more  details  we will recall below the notions of algebraic reachability and algebraic semi algebraic observability for rational  systems. define the set of reachable states of a rational  system r of the form     as rr         rr            t    t          u  y   is a solution of r              .  the system r is said to be algebraically reachable  if there  is no non trivial polynomial which is zero on rr      . the  system r is called accessible  if rr       contains an open  subset of rn . it is clear that accessibility of r implies  algebraic reachability of r.  for a rational system r as in definition   with statespace rn   recall from      definition  .    or from      definition    that observation algebra of r  denoted by  aobs  r   is the smallest sub algebra of the field of rational  hk      k      . . .   p  functions r x    . . .   xn   which contains hk    and which is closed under taking the formalp  lie derivatives  p     with respect to the formal vector fields f    ni   qi    .  i    xi  if r is polynomial  i.e. qi        i      . . .   n  hk         k      . . .   p  then aobs  r  is the sub algebra of the ring of  polynomials r x    . . .   xn  . following      we say that the  rational system r is algebraically observable  if aobs  r     r x    . . .   xn  . following      that r is semi algebraically  observable if trdeg aobs  r     n. we will say that r     is observable  if for every two distinct initial states                there exists solutions     u  y  and      u  y   of r such that                                    and y    y . it is easy to see that  algebraic observability implies semi algebraic observability.  moreover  for polynomial systems algebraic observability  implies observability    .  recall from      theorem    that a rational system r  is minimal  if and only if it is algebraically reachable and  semi algebraically observable.  lemma    sufficient conditions for minimality   if one of  the conditions below holds  then   is   minimal realization  of p     raux     is semi algebraically observable and algebraically reachable.    raux     is polynomial  it is algebraically observable  and algebraically reachable.    raux     is polynomial  it is algebraically observable  and accessible.     the above lemma is then a direct consequence of lemma    and      proposition     its detailed proof is presented in    .  b. a hankel rank like condition for minimality of rnns  in this part  we relate minimality of an rnn   with  the transcendence degree of the observation algebra aobs  p   defined in definition   . recall that a linear system is a  minimal realization of its input output map  if and only if  the dimension of this system equals the rank of the hankelmatrix constructed from the markov parameters of this inputoutput map. we would like to formulate a similar result   where the role of the rank of the hankel matrix is played  by the observation algebra aobs  p . to this end  recall from       lemma    theorem    that r    is minimal if and  only if dim r       trdegaobs  p . in a similar manner  if  aobs  p   is the observation algebra of the input output map  p  defined in      then raux     is minimal if and only if  dim raux        trdegaobs  p  . note that aobs  p   is a subalgebra of aobs  p  generated by the elements of the form  d         d l pk   l      k      . . .   p       . . .    l   u. the  following lemma is then a direct consequence of lemma    and lemma  .  lemma    hankel rank like conditions for minimality    assume that   satisfies  a    and let the rnn       a  b  c  u     x    be a realization of the inputoutput map p. if one of the following conditions hold for  n   dim        trdegaobs  p    n      u n    or    trdegaobs  p     n u n    then   is a   minimal realization of p.  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  c. some aspects of reachability and observability of rnns  one may wonder how restrictive the conditions of lemma    are  and how they relate to accessibility reachability and  observability of the rnn   studied in               . in  fact  observability and reachability properties of raux      imply similar properties of the rnn  . in order to present  this relationship more precisely  we introduce the following  terminology. define the reachable set of an rnn       a  b  c  u     x     r   x       x t    t        x  u  y   is a solution of    x      x   .  we will say that   is accessible  if r   x    contains an open  subset of rn   we say that   is algebraically reachable if  there is no non trivial polynomial which is zero on r   x   .  we say that   is span reachable  if the linear span of the  elements r   x    is rn   i.e.   is reachable if there exist  no linear function which is zero on r   x   . clearly  if    is accessible  then it is algebraically reachable  and if   is  algebraically reachable  then it is span reachable. we say that  the rnn   is weakly observable if for every initial state  x    rn there is an open subset v of rn such that x    v  and for every x     x   v   there exist solution  x  u  y  and   x    u  y     of    with x      x  and x        x  such that    y    y   . then the rnn   is observable if for every initial  state x    rn   v   rn in the latter definition.  lemma    let      a  b  c  u     x    be an rnn.    if raux     is algebraically reachable  then   is spanreachable. in particular  if raux     is accessible  then    is span reachable.    if raux     is polynomial  and it is observable  and if  the function   is invertible and ker a  is trivial  then    is observable. in particular  if raux is algebraically  observable  then   is observable.    if raux     is polynomial  and it is semi algebraically  observable  and if the function   is invertible and  ker a  is trivial  then   is weakly observable.  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  remark    invertibility of     note that assuming that the  activation function   is invertible is not too restrictive as  it holds for many commonly used activation functions  see  example  .  observe that accessibility  and algebraic   semi algebraically  observability conditions for rational   polynomial systems  can be checked by using methods of computer algebra     .  in contrast  for checking accessibility and  weak  observability of an rnn the only systematic tools are the rank  conditions     theorem  .   theorem  .   theorem  .    theorem  .   or      corollary  . .   corollary  . .    which  are not computationally effective.  remark     minimality of rnn as an analytic system    from      theorem  .    it follows that if the rnn    is accessible and weakly observable  then it is a minimal  realization of its input output map p. from the comparison  between the conditions of lemma   with those of lemma    it is clear that minimality of raux     is a much weaker  condition than accessibility and weak observability of   . this suggests that using realization theory of rational  systems is likely to yield more useful results for rnns than  using realization theory of general analytic systems.  recall from     theorem    that a necessary condition for  observability of      a  b  c  u     x    is that the largest  a invariant coordinate subspace of   included in ker c   is trivial. more precisely  following     we say that a vector  subspace v of rn is a coordinate subspace if it is spanned by  some vectors from the canonical basis of rn   i.e. there exists  an integer s     and integers i    . . .   is       . . .   n  such  that v is spanned by ei    . . .   eis   where  e    . . .   en   denotes  the canonical basis of rn . we write oc  a  c  the largest  coordinate subspace which is a invariant and contained in  ker c .  lemma    if raux     is polynomial and it is semialgebraically observable  then there exists no non trivial  coordinate subspace which is a invariant and contained in  ker c   i.e. oc  a  c       .  the proof of lemma   is presented in    .  by     theorem    oc  a  c         it is also sufficient  if ker c    ker a         the activation function   satisfies  only the ipp property  given in     for example  and if b  verifies a condition on its rows. but here we do not need the  latter hypothesis on  .     example    let     r   r be the sigmoid function as  in example  . consider the rnn with activation function     defined as follows      x       x    u   x       x    u        x        x           y   x              here a      b         t   c          and u         r   u is a fixed real number. the auxiliary rational system  associated with   is then given by                                                               raux                               u               y          where  k   x k for k       . denote by f the vector field  generated by raux    . the output map is here h                   simply written h        a raux     . we clearly have  lf h   h         h    a raux       where lf is the lie  derivative operator along the vector field f . moreover we get  lf h       h   h     and the latter belongs to the field of fractions  of a raux     . thus the latter field is equal to r             which shows that raux     is semi algebraically observable.  by lemma    the rnn   is weakly observable.  vi. c onclusions  we have shown that input output maps of a large class  of recurrent neural networks can be represented by rational polynomial systems  and we used this fact to derive  necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a realization by a recurrent neural network and its minimality.  future research will be directed towards deriving a more  complete realization theory of recurrent neural network and  for using the results of realization theory for analyzing  machine learning algorithms.  a ppendix  in this appendix  we write all the technical proofs.  proof   proof of lemma    if   verifies  a     it  satisfies  a    consider the algebra aobs       . . .    n   genereted  by      . . .    n and their high order derivatives  i.e.    k   aobs       . . .    n   is generated by   j  n  k n j   . since       . . .    n are analytic  aobs       . . .    n   is the sub algebra  of the algebra of all real analytic functions  and hence it  is an integral domain. note that   i     is algebraic over       . . .    n . indeed  it suffices to take qk  x    . . .   xn         xn    vk  x    . . . xn     uk  x    . . .   xn    for     k   n    and then qi    i        . . .    n        i      . . .   n and  qo          . . .    n       by taking the rth derivative of  qi    i        . . .    n    qo          . . .    n        we can conclude   r   that the rth derivative  i      r  of  i and   respectively    l  r   n  r   n  are algebraic over   k  l   k   and   kl      l   l   k      and   r   hence  by induction on r  we can conclude that  i      r   are algebraic over      . . .    n . hence  the algebra aobs      generated by     r      r   is algebraic over      . . .    n and    hence the transcedence degree of aobs     is at most n .  the latter means that there exist a non zero polynomial q  such that q    . . .      n          i.e. assumption  a   holds.  if   satisfies  a    then it satisfes  a  . let k        . . .   n  . it suffices here to take derivatives the equation      in assumption  a    as follows    q        . . .      n        n         xn     n  x   qk      . . .      n       l          xl  l      then set  i      i      i      . . .   n     and vk      uk      and un       xk     k         . . .   n   and vn       x q  n     pn  q  i    xi  x    . . .   xn  xi .  proof   proof of lemma    let      a  b  c     x    be  an rnn and let  x  u  y  be a solution of    for a given u    upc . without loss of generality  we suppose that u t         u. as in the statement of lemma    write   t    f  x t        for t    . clearly we have  i j      i etj  ax   b     for  i       . . .   n    j       . . .   n  and     u  where            . . .    n   are analytic functions as in    . thus it suffices  to prove that  i j   satisfies the differential equation given in  definition  . by taking the first derivative  we obtain    i j    t             i    n    x  etj  ax   b      aj l x l  t       l           n     ui     j    t   . . .    n j    t   x     aj l   etl  ax   b      vi

for all     u  k       . . .   p   u   upc and t      we have     d   pk  u    t   s   d  pk  u  t     ds    s    n        x  d  ck i  xi  t   s  u        ds    s    i    n  n      x  x  ai j xj  t  u

recurrent neural networks     with n    dim        dim      n. it is clear that we have dim raux          dim raux       where raux      is the rational system given  in definition     associated with   . hence it contradicts the  fact that raux     is a minimal rational realization as claimed  in the statement of lemma  . thus   is a minimal rnn  realization of its input output map.  proof   proof of lemma    let      a  b  c     x    be  an rnn.     assume that raux     is algebraically reachable  i.e.  there is no non trivial polynomial vanishing in the  reachable set  rraux                t    t          u  y   is a solution of raux                  .  hence the components of   t  are algebraically independent  for t    . now take u   upc and  x  u  y   a solution of the rnn  . suppose that  for t       x   t   . . . xn  t  are linearly dependant. without loss of  generality  we can say that there are real values not all  trivial      . . .    n   such that  xn  t       n    x     i xi  t  .    i      by taking the first derivative of the latter equation  we  get  x n  t       n    x  i       i x i  t       which implies that we have  x n  t     n  y    v   vl u t         n    x     i x i  t     i      l        u   vn u t       n    y    n  y    v   vl u t       l      v   vl u t       l           n    x  i      u   vi u t       n  y    v   vl u t        .    l   l  i    this is a contradiction by hypothesis of the statement.  finally x   t   . . .   xn  t  are linearly independent. thus  it says that the rnn is span reachable.     assume that raux     is polynomial and observable in  the sense of distinguishable states. moreover suppose  that the activation function   is invertible and that  ker a  is trivial. take two initial states x  x    rn  such that there exist solutions  x  u  y  and  x    u  y      of    such that x      x  x        x  and y   y   .  we now prove that x   x . by using lemma   and  definition     it is easy to prove that there are solutions         u   yk    k     and        u   yk     k     of the rational     system raux      with  j              etj  ax b   and            j            etj  ax    b     such that yk     yk       for j       . . .   n   k       . . .   p  and     u. as  raux     is polynomial  it follows that we have       etj  ax   b     u    j              u    j                   etj  ax    b        by using assumption  a  . as   is invertible  we get  x   x    ker a   which implies that x   x  because  ker a       . thus the rnn   is observable.     assume that raux     is polynomial and it is semialgebraically observable. moreover suppose that the  activation function   is invertible and that ker a  is  trivial. from      proposition  .    corollary  .      raux     is weakly observable  i.e. for every initial  state      rn u  n there exists an open set w of  rn u  n such that  for all     w   there are solutions      u  y  and        u  y     of raux     verifying                         and y    y   . consider now the map  f    rn   rn u  n   x     z    . . .   znn  u     which is  the composition of a projection map with the map  f   rn   rn u   n     defined in lemma  . thus  it is a continuous map  and it is straightforward to  check that  for u   upc and  x  u  y  a solution of  the rnn        u   yk      is a solution of the rational  system raux      where   t    f   x t   for t    .  by continuity of the map f    r   rn  u  n        v    f       w   is an open set of rn . thus  by using  similar arguments as in the proof of second point of  lemma    for every initial states x   x   v   there are  solutions  x  u  y  and  x    u  y     of the rnn   such  that x      x   x        x and y    y   . hence the rnn    is weakly observable.     proof   proof of lemma    assume that the rational system raux     is semi algebraically observable  i.e.  trdegaobs  raux        nkn . suppose that there is a nontrivial coordinate space v which is a invariant and included  in ker c . we have  v   span ei   i   i       with      i       . . .   n  .    as v is included in ker c   it means that  for i   i  the  i th column of c is trivial. moreover saying that v is ainvariant means that  for j    i and k   i  ajk    . we  recall that the output of the rational system r    is given  as follows   n  x  x  ck i xi  t     ck j xj  t      k       . . .   p    yk  t     i      j j    where j       . . .   n  i. the output map y  k  t  of the  rational system raux     at time t is constructed from  the output map of r    by taking the first derivative  by  leamma  . thus  for k       . . .   p  and     u  we get  yk    t       n  x  i      ck i    u    i    t   x  u    j    t       ck j  v    i    t    v    j    t    j j    for k      . . .   p. as aj l     for j   j and l   i  we  just need to take the variables  i j   with i       . . .   n     j   j and     u. because  i j   satisfies now the following  differential equation   n      i j    t       u    l    t    ui   j    t   x     aj l     vi   j    t    v    l    t    l      n  ui   j    t   x  u    l    t          aj l      if u t      .  vi   j    t    v    l    t    l j    by some calculations  it is possible to prove that the fraction  of field of aobs  raux      is included in the fraction of field  of the ring  r  i j         u   i       . . .   n     j   j     so that trdegaobs  raux         j  d n   n dn   because  i      implying that  j    n. this is a contradiction.  hence there is no non trivial coordinate subspace a invariant  included in ker c .
